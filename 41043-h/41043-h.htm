<h2>THE OLD FIRST</h2>




<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE COAST ARTILLERY</h3>


<p>When Chaplain Minot J. Savage first listened to the
“March of the First,” inspiration fired his soul; the music
was repeating a message to him. Was there something in
the brazen voice of the horns, a magical harmony of sound
with sense; or was it merely the loyal Chaplain’s imagination?
At any rate this is what he heard:</p>

<div class="container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0">“We’re brothers of all noble men,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who wear our country’s blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We brothers find in any race,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where men are brave and true.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But we’ve a pride in our own band,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And we are all agreed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever grand deeds others do,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The ‘Old First’ still shall lead.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">So while our feet keep music time,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Our hearts are proudly beating<br /></span>
<span class="i8">An echo to Man’s forward hope<br /></span>
<span class="i10">That never knows retreating.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="cont">And now, whenever “Adjutant’s call” sounds and the companies
move into line with the precision and rhythmic swing
characteristic of well-trained troops, they also hear the message
which was written down for them by the Chaplain many
years ago, “The Old First still shall lead.” They hear and
believe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Today it becomes the privilege of another Chaplain to set
forth in this little book the reasons why the Old First believes
in itself. We shall see how the present grows out of
a long and noble past. Back in Civil War times observers
noted that the regiment was one to be proud of; there was
a large proportion of sensible, solid men who enlisted because
it seemed duty, whose patriotism was not silly or vulgar,
but strong and serious. Today likewise the Inspector
General reports that the personnel is unexcelled; only men
of good character are enlisted; standards are very high.
And for the largest part the men are not in the service for
any personal profit to themselves&mdash;there is too little pay to
make money the attraction. They are soldiers at the sacrifice
of their own leisure, and often of their comfort. A
modern National Guardsman is averse to boasting or
heroics&mdash;he is the most matter-of-fact citizen of all. But
surely the Chaplain will be pardoned for saying, what the
Guardsman would be most reluctant to claim, that in the old
regiment patriotism is not a matter of words, it is made up
of deeds.</p>

<p>Massachusetts looks in large degree to the command for
the coast defence of Boston. America’s center of wealth
and manufacturing, the Commonwealth holds the key to the
whole country. Within a radius of two hundred miles from
Boston is manufactured practically every kind of supply
and equipment; while New York, the world’s center of
wealth and finance, is only slightly more than two hundred
miles away. To possess Massachusetts would afford hostile
invaders the best possible base; the Coast Artillery is an
essential factor in the defence of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Coast artillery affords the most magnificent team-sport in
the world. Three officers and sixty-seven men work together
in firing the twelve-inch rifle, and each contributes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
something essential to the success of the shot. Twelve
inches is the bore of the rifled gun; forty-two or more feet
the length; $45,000 is the cost, and the carriage represents
an investment of $40,000 more. It is loaded with three hundred
twenty-five pounds of powder, and a projectile weighing
more than half a ton, costing upwards of $150, and sufficient
in itself to destroy a hostile warship. The target, the
moving target, at which the shot is fired, floats on the water
at a distance of eight to sixteen miles; and without the use
of powerful glasses is all but invisible. Range and direction
(azimuth) are determined by a combination of most
delicate scientific observing instruments. Now the great
gun swings majestically into place. “Fire!” A concussion
follows as if many railroad trains were coupling&mdash;mighty,
stunning. Then ensue seconds of eager watching from the
battery, but not many such; for the projectile travels twice
as fast as sound itself. Up spouts a column of sea water
beside the target. A <i>hit</i>. And this will be repeated once per
minute until the enemy is put out of action.</p>

<p>Camping, shooting, gymnastics, hiking, fencing, horseback-riding,
and even boating and aviation all enter into the
training of the Coast Artilleryman. Opportunity is given to
learn much of mechanical, electrical and engineering science.</p>

<p>On its lighter side military life includes balls, parades,
dinners, theater-parties, smokers, and the annual January
athletic games. Once in four years there is a trip to the
inauguration at Washington; lesser excursions occupy
some of the intervening time. Most valuable of all are the
life-long friendships formed by men who stand side by side
in the service of the country. These endure and keep warm
after all else is forgotten.</p>

<p>The better soldier a man learns to be, the better citizen he
makes himself. Such training in team-work is of priceless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
value; this service has become a passport to business success,
and today there is no better recommendation for employment.
Civil Service commissioners recognize the enhanced
usefulness of the trained soldier by according him
preference in government appointments.</p>

<p>Six of the companies come from stations outside of Boston,&mdash;Brockton,
Cambridge, Chelsea, Fall River, New Bedford
and Taunton being represented. Even more truly than
the Boston companies these organizations offer advantages
of the greatest value; each is the pride of its own home city;
each ranks amongst the leading social bodies in its community;
and the armories, all fine structures, are popular
club houses.</p>

<p>Altho it may be hard to “live up” to the responsibilities
of a noble ancestry and one is ever open to the unkind
suggestion that his best is like the potatoes, “under ground,”
still it is not the fault of a man, nor of an organization, if
the record of the past contains worthy, and even heroic,
passages. Not only is the Coast Artillery the surviving
heir to most of Boston’s finest militia traditions and honors,
but by the consolidation of 1878 it also inherits the proud
record of the Third Regiment, the militia force of Pilgrim-land
and the Cape. Even a more modest organization than
this would be excused for feeling thrills when it remembers
“auld lang syne”; and the gentle reader will peruse these
pages in vain if he fails to see why.</p>

<p>Some day the command will establish a military museum
of its own, in which to display its trophies and relics. Its
battle-flags have mostly passed out of its reach and are irrevocably
in the possession of the Commonwealth. When one
visits the Hall of Flags and gazes reverently upon the tattered
silk banners of the 1st Infantry, five in number, the 3d
Infantry, two of them, the 24th Infantry, two, the 42d Infantry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and the 43d and the 44th, two each, and in the Spanish
War case the two colors of the 1st Heavy Artillery,
seventeen flags in all, one may possibly remember that a
Massachusetts Coast Artilleryman would be whispering to
himself, “Those are our battle-flags.” And there are many
other colors in the cases, under which members of the command
fought during the Civil War&mdash;those of the 4th, 5th,
6th, 13th, 29th Infantry Regiments, and the 4th Heavy
Artillery.</p>

<p>Indeed the sole battle-flag remaining from the Mexican
War, that of the 1st Mass. Volunteer Infantry, may be
claimed as a Coast Artillery trophy, since it was given by
those who had borne it into the custody of the veterans who
made up the National Guards, the 9th Co. of Coast Artillery.
The National Guards eventually surrendered this color to
the Commonwealth. No less a personage than Gen. Winfield
Scott had been the original donor of the flag.</p>

<p>In some unexplained manner, three colors carried by the
1st Infantry during the Civil War escaped the State collector,
and are preserved with religious care at the South
Armory. They are the American flag presented by former
Boston men who had “gone west” and there organized the
National Guard of San Francisco, a blue infantry color presented
in 1863 by the City of Boston, and a white State flag
retained to replace a lost Commonwealth color presented by
the people of Chelsea. As often as May 25 rolls around,
veterans of the regiment bear these flags, together with the
present National colors of the command, to the hall where
the anniversary dinner is held; and under the sacred silken
folds the white-haired warriors renew the memories of Fredericksburg
and Chancellorsville, of Gettysburg and Spotsylvania,
while they smack their lips over something more
savory than the hard-tack and muddy coffee of bygone days.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Last winter these same veterans reviewed the Corps in the
South Armory. As they came marching on the floor under
their tattered battle-flags amid deafening cheers from hundreds
of onlookers, strong men could hardly choke back
their tears.</p>

<p>Post 23, G. A. R., of Boston, and Post 35 of Chelsea possess
some 1st Regiment relics.</p>

<p>Headquarters will contribute to the regimental museum
the sleeve of Drum Major James F. Clark’s coat, with its
wonderful collection of service-stripes indicative of forty-one
years’ service. Sergeant Clark died in office in 1910.
There is also an old commission in a frame on the
Headquarters’ wall, that of George S. Newell as Colonel
of the 1st Reg., 1st Bri., 1st Div., dated May 11, 1839,
signed by John P. Bigelow, Secretary of the Commonwealth;
and the warrant of Daniel Horatio Belknap as Quartermaster
Sergeant of the 1st Reg., 3d Bri., 1st Div., issued
July 20, 1824, by Col. Louis Lerow. Between 1831 and
1834 the Roxbury Artillery had been temporarily attached
to the 1st Reg., 1st Bri., but in Colonel Newell’s day we
had no connection at all with that organization; the Fusiliers
were a part of the 1st Reg., 3d Bri., in 1824, when Sergt.
Belknap was in office.</p>

<p>Partly because it is the oldest company, and partly because
it has always been made up of men who “do things,” the 1st
Company possesses by far the finest collection of historical
valuables of all the regiment. Indeed fully one-half of the
regimental museum is already collected, and belongs to Capt.
Joseph H. Hurney’s organization. In their room one
sees Capt. J. J. Spooner’s original commission signed in
1784 by Gov. John Hancock, the first flag carried by the
company&mdash;a flag with fourteen stars, the complete parchment
roll of members from the very beginning, a drum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
which helped to keep up the company’s courage at Blackburn’s
Ford and Bull Run, specimen uniforms and arms
showing the development of military skill and taste during
each period of the company’s history, and a small cannon
captured by Washington from the British at Yorktown in
1781, and at Williamsburg in 1862 taken from the Confederates
by a company of ours.</p>

<p>Shooting, military and athletic trophies almost without
number adorn the walls of Headquarters and of each company
room; but these can hardly be included in a regimental
museum. The 6th and 7th Companies hold Knox trophies
as proof of their preeminent excellence in artillery work,
and will doubtless resent any suggestion of contributing
them to anyone else; certainly other companies have been
trying hard enough to get this, and have not succeeded even
for a single year. But the museum will have the 2d Company’s
original drum, dated 1798, and with it the first flag.
Their most valuable possession is a Stuart oil portrait
of their “patron saint,” George Washington. The same
company also display a set of ancient by-laws inherited
from their predecessor, the Independent Light Infantry,
and perhaps also a set of their ancient breast-plates. If
more is demanded, members of the company will fill their
lungs and emit the old “tiger” yell or growl; and this is
certain to prove sufficient so far as the 2d Company is concerned.
The 3d Company room does not contain much of
historical interest. Their proudest possession is an entry
on the records of the Governor’s Council dated May 11,
1787, wherein it appears that a petition presented by Thomas
Adams and fifty-three others was granted, and that a military
company, the Independent Boston Fusiliers, was formally
established in the eyes of the law. On the following
Fourth of July the Fusiliers received their charter from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Gov. James Bowdoin, while formed on the slope of Bunker
Hill, and forthwith regaled themselves as guests at the
hospitable table of Gov. (to be) John Hancock. Maj.
James W. H. Myrick, Commander of the Fusilier Veteran
Association, is custodian of the original 3d Company
records.</p>

<p>We shall see that the Coast Artilleryman has reason
for singing “The Old First still shall lead”; but the historian
faces a difficulty when he essays to explain who the
Coast Artillery are, anyway. Three different regiments are
consolidated in the present body&mdash;which was the original?
But see, what’s here! The regimental museum will solve
even this vexed problem of genealogy. A resolve by the
General Court of Massachusetts, duly engrossed and framed,
together with an order of the Council approved by Gov.
John L. Bates on April 6, 1903, not only certifies that the
First Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteer Militia responded
to the call of the President of the United States
in April, 1861, for troops to suppress the rebellion, but also,
and more importantly as concerning our present difficulty,
that the First Massachusetts Heavy Artillery are the “successors”
of the regiment of 1861. Blessings upon the head
of the man whose influence secured this legislative action!
The historian may tread fearlessly in full assurance that
the Coast Artillery is the First Infantry of Civil War fame,
and that other ancestry is, if not collateral, at least not in
the principal line. A complete genealogy of the command
will be found elsewhere in this book.</p>

<p>One explanation is in order before proceeding. On April
25, 1842, the companies were designated by letter; on
Nov. 1, 1905, they ceased to be designated by letter, and
were numbered in order of charter-seniority. Altho all
company and regimental history between 1842 and 1905<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
was recorded in terms of company letters, since 1905 the
letters have rapidly passed into oblivion; and today have
become almost entirely forgotten. For the purpose of interpreting
the past in terms intelligible to the present, it seems
best to translate letters into numerals&mdash;to speak, in other
words, of the 1st Company rather than Company or Battery
D. And now, the prelude being finished and the audience all
having visited the museum, let the performance go forward.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>1784-1840</h3>


<p>A group of men were assembled in the living room of a
prosperous looking Roxbury farmhouse on March 22, 1784.
Altho they had met several times previously during the
winter, they showed by both word and bearing that they
were actually engaged in transacting their most important
business on the present occasion. General William Heath,
owner of the house, presided. As everyone in Roxbury well
knew, the General had lately returned from war, where he
had enjoyed the privilege of close companionship and
friendship with no less a person than the commander, Gen.
George Washington, himself. Another of the company was
a wealthy young merchant of Roxbury, an ex-Cadet, John
Jones Spooner, who stood in the relationship of son-in-law
to Gen. Heath. Amongst others were Jonathan Warner and
several more Revolutionary veterans; also two prominent
members of Roxbury society, Joseph Pierpont and John
Swift. Well might these men look important for they were
engaged in presiding over a birth&mdash;the birth of a National
Guard company&mdash;today the oldest National Guard company
with continuous history in America.</p>

<p>As soon as the company had been born, and was reported
to be “doing well,” it was christened. “The Roxbury Train
of Artillery” was inscribed with due form and ceremony
upon the first page of its record book. Who was then sufficiently
far-sighted to foresee that on June 30, 1916, the
same company would take the Federal oath as the “1st Company,
Coast Artillery Corps, National Guard of Massachusetts”?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
A company in those days was commanded by a captain
with the rank of Major; and this office was promptly
conferred upon John Jones Spooner. Jonathan Warner
became the “Captain-lieutenant,” and Joseph Pierpont and
John Swift were elected the other two lieutenants, as at
that time authorized. Warrants were issued to four sergeants;
four musicians were appointed, twenty-four men
were detailed as cannoneers, eight as pioneers, three as
drivers&mdash;and when two brass four-pounder cannon had been
issued to them, the Roxbury Artillery were ready for any
kind of a fight or frolic. It was not to be until Aug. 30,
1849, that Gen. H. A. S. Dearborn would suggest the famous
motto now borne by the Company, “In time of peace prepare
for war.” No one can question however but that the sentiment
of the motto has always controlled 1st Company
activities.</p>

<p>Major Spooner subsequently resigned his command, was
succeeded by Capt. Warner; and himself became a minister
of the gospel.</p>

<p>Those were the days immediately following the Revolutionary
war; and in America during such seasons the commanding
military official is sure to be “general apathy.”
Owing partly to the absence of other organized companies,
and partly to the skill and enthusiasm of the Roxbury men,
the Artillery were in frequent demand. On October 15,
1784, they turned out to fire a salute in honor of a distinguished
visitor, Gen. Lafayette. The Boston Train of Artillery,
afterwards the 8th Company, came into existence
May 7, 1785; and these two organizations shared the honor
of escorting the Governor and members of the General
Court on July 4, 1785, and again the year following. The
fact is, these were the only two active military companies
in or around Boston at the time. On one of these occasions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Gen. Heath noted concerning his protégés that they “made a
good appearance and performed their exercises well.” An
army travels upon its stomach, and a good soldier attends
carefully to the subsistence part of his work. The 1st Company
displayed true soldierly instincts by including, from
the very beginning, commissary exercises amongst their
other activities,&mdash;in other words, at the conclusion of the
parade “they dined together.” Music was furnished for
these military displays by the only band then in Boston, one
consisting of Hessians who remained behind from Burgoyne’s
army, under the leadership of Frederick Granger.</p>

<p>Let the narrative pause a minute while we paint in a
background for the picture. Do we understand who the
militia are? Citizen-soldiers, citizens who serve as soldiers
when necessary, without relinquishing their civil occupations,
part-time fighting men&mdash;such have always been the
chief reliance of free peoples when it becomes necessary to
defend their territory or to enforce their sovereign will. In
British dominions this military force received the name of
“train-band” about 1600, and began to be called “militia”
in 1660. Moreover their service was both compulsory and
universal&mdash;at least it was so in theory. Each citizen was
required by law to provide himself with a “good musket or
firelock, a sufficient bayonet, and belt, two spare flints, and
a knapsack.” Thus armed and equipped, he was expected
to present himself four times a year for a day’s training.</p>

<p>It is customary to heap ridicule upon the militia. Cowper
described “John Gilpin” as a “train-band captain,” and
taught us to laugh at him. Yankee Doodle, with its “men
and boys as thick as hasty puddin’,” is a parody on the
American militia. In truth appearances were against them
in the olden times. Their history began away back in the
days when military costume consisted of an iron hat and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
steel vest. When, about 1700, armor passed out of use, the
militiamen, to prove that they were true conservatives, refused
to substitute any other uniform clothing. Consequently
they did not look soldierly. But the Yankee Doodle
militia under Johnson at Lake George administered a stinging
defeat to the French regulars. We have been abundantly
taught of late how American military history fairly
bristles with evidence that the militia system is faulty. So
be it. Now it is time to point out another lesson from
the same history, namely, that when American militia have
fought under favorable conditions, with some shelter, and
with an auspicious beginning to the action, they have often
manifested a valor that makes the world marvel, a valor
unequalled except in the annals of legendary warfare.</p>

<p>This militia existed, in 1784, thruout Massachusetts (and
Maine) as nine divisions of approximately five thousand men
each. The first division was stationed in Boston. And, alas!
all divisions were temporarily inactive.</p>

<p>The oldest volunteer militia company in England, as well
as its “ancient” daughter in America, have as part of their
title the word “Honorable.” Militia rendered such military
service as the law demanded. Volunteer militia went beyond
this, and in addition uniformed themselves at their
own expense, drilled frequently, and held themselves in
readiness for parades and ceremonies, and, in sterner vein,
for disturbance of the peace and for war. As the basis of
every volunteer army our country raised was found the organized,
volunteer militia. No wonder that esteem and distinction
have attached to this service. Since 1908 the force
has borne the title, “National Guard,” a name going back
to the citizen soldiery who defended Paris in 1789 and who
were commanded by Lafayette, a name brought to this country
in 1824 by Lafayette himself and then first adopted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the N. Y. 7th Reg., and in 1862 taken by all the organized
militia of that state, in 1903 extended thruout the United
States, and in 1916 officially substituted for all other titles
in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Why was it necessary for the Roxbury men to organize
their company? Could not the U. S. regular army afford
America sufficient protection in 1784? Regular army! So
far as Congress could control the matter, there was no regular
army in 1784. A determined effort had been made the
year previous to wipe the force entirely out of existence,
to muster out every Continental remaining over from the
Revolutionary war. Thru some oversight one single company,
that formerly commanded by Alexander Hamilton and
now “Battery F of the 3d Field Artillery,” had escaped.
Perhaps because they were standing guard over valuable
stores at West Point and elsewhere, perhaps because the
mustering-out officer ran short of blank forms&mdash;for some
unexplained reason one company survived. This single
company constituted the entire U. S. army in 1784. This
one company is the only military organization in America
having continuous existence, which antedates the Massachusetts
Coast Artillery. Moreover the situation was only
slightly better later. In 1787 there were only 1,200 regulars,
in 1798, 2,100, and at the opening of the Civil War, with a
national area almost equal to the present, less than 10,000.
Were not Gen. Heath and the Roxbury men justified in
taking steps to strengthen the forces of government?</p>

<p>If we may now resume the narrative, we note that the
Dorchester Artillery, the 4th Company, was organized in
1786. Material was preparing out of which the future regiment
might be built.</p>

<p>1786 and 1787 were years of threatening and storm in
Massachusetts. In consequence of the war, people found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
themselves burdened with debts and taxes. They complained
that the Governor’s salary was too high, the senate
aristocratic, the lawyers extortionate, and that the courts
were instruments of oppression, especially in the collection
of debts. By way of remedy they demanded the removal
of the General Court from Boston, the relief of debtors, and
the issue of a large amount of paper money. Daniel Shays,
an ex-captain of the Continental army, placed himself at
the head of a movement to secure these ends by force, and
his effort has come down thru history as “Shays’ rebellion.”</p>

<p>In December, 1786, he appeared at Springfield with one
thousand insurgents, resolved to break up the session of the
supreme court. After forcing the adjournment of the session,
the insurgents directed an attack against the arsenal in
Springfield. Meanwhile the State government had sent Gen.
Benjamin Lincoln, at the head of four thousand militia,
amongst whom were included our artillery companies, to
suppress the disorder; and on Jan. 25, 1787,&mdash;six days after
leaving Boston,&mdash;the troops arrived in season to beat off the
insurgent attack. Shays and his followers were pursued as
far as Petersham, where on Feb. 9 all armed resistance was
crushed out and the insurgents captured or dispersed. Since
there was such abundant ground for this discontent, it is
pleasing to know that the “rebels” were all pardoned, and
Shays himself finally awarded a pension for his Revolutionary
services. Improved economic conditions due to the new
Federal constitution soon removed all danger of such disorder
in the future. Please note, however, that winter campaigning
in western Massachusetts is by no means an attractive
holiday experience, and that the members of the
command who engaged in this, the first, active service,
manifested the same plucky devotion to duty as has characterized
them ever since.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>When in 1788 the new United States constitution was ratified,
Boston felt moved to celebrate the event. Gen. Benjamin
Lincoln, who commanded the train-band division in
the city, investigated and found that he had eight uniformed
companies amongst his militia organizations. So the eight
were directed to parade. The Dorchester Artillery were not
present; but the Roxbury and Boston companies had prominent
places in the procession. There were three other companies
present, infantry companies, which would have interested
anyone gifted with prophetic foresight. For just
ninety years from that time, the three infantry companies
were destined to unite with the two artillery in forming
the 1st Regiment of today. Meanwhile, unconscious of the
future, they are all parading in honor of the new Federal
government; watch them. Grave, dignified men they are.
And no wonder; for they are the social and political leaders
of Boston-town. No one could hope for election to office in
those days unless he had “done his bit” in the militia. They
wore the Continental uniform, with cocked hats, blue coats
having ample skirts, and white knickerbockers. In their
movements they were majestic, slow, deliberate; seventy-five
steps per minute were considered amply sufficient. It
was not until 1891 that their hustling offspring completed
the process of raising the military cadence to one hundred
twenty per minute, with a pace thirty inches long. For
weapons they carried smooth-bore flint-locks, which the dictionary
tells us, were known as snaphaunces or “fusils,”
whence we have the term, “fusiliers.” The musket was
furnished by the State, and was the only part of the equipment
so provided. Never mind if they were not very
deadly,&mdash;they at least looked formidable. Our artillery
companies drew their cannon from the “gun-house” on the
common; contrast this rough shed with the South Armory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of today! After the martial exhibition was concluded, our
forefathers betook themselves to the “Green Dragon,” or the
“Bunch of Grapes,” or the “Exchange Coffee House” where
coffee was by no means the limit, or some other popular
tavern, for the military exercises which constituted the
climax of the entire day.</p>

<p>A clear distinction existed between militia and volunteers
in the foot branch of the service, the volunteers being designated
fusiliers or grenadiers or light infantry or rifles or
cadets, and the militia being known as infantry. But the
distinction was obscured in the “train of artillery.” So
much of technical qualification was required of the artilleryman
and cavalryman that all companies of such troops had
to meet the higher military standards of volunteers and were
so classified. In such rosters as existed, it was customary
to print the names of company officers of artillery and cavalry,
while such lists included only field officers in foot commands.</p>

<p>First mention of a battalion of artillery appears in the
roster of the 1st division for 1790, when the four companies
in Boston, Dorchester, Middlesex and Roxbury are so designated.
No field officer had yet been commissioned. This
is the beginning of the Coast Artillery, the battalion and
regimental organization having continued in unbroken existence
from 1789 to the present time. While under every
militia law ever adopted by Congress, not only the 1st Company
but also the command as a larger unit might claim
“ancient privileges” on the ground of continuous organization
thruout these decades, it is just and right to state that
the pride of the “Old First” has always been not to claim
any privilege at all, except that of serving wherever and
however it could be of the most use. At this date no battalion
organization existed amongst the volunteer foot companies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
each being an “independent” divisionary corps of
infantry.</p>

<p>October, 1789, our companies were again in line, this time
to receive and escort the President of the United States,
George Washington. In October, 1793, a sadder duty summoned
them forth. John Hancock, patriot, signer of the
declaration of independence, Governor of Massachusetts,
and President of the Continental Congress, had finished his
long and noble career and gone to his rest. Boston loved
and honored its chief citizen; the funeral parade, in which
our companies participated, was an expression of heart-felt
grief. The companies were again called out on July 4th,
1795, to help lay the corner-stone of the new State-house,
the famous “Bulfinch front.”</p>

<p>War clouds began to darken the political sky in 1794,
war clouds generated by the titanic struggle between the
French and their enemies thruout Europe. Controversies
had been going on between us and both parties to the great
European conflict; now this particular danger threatened
from the French side. Altho most Americans had sympathized
with the French in their revolutionary struggle, had
worn tri-colored cockades and clamored for a French alliance,
now French colors disappeared from view, men wore
black, and “Hail Columbia,” with “independence” for its
“boast,” became the popular song. As soon as America
found itself involved in the threatened storm, Congress began
to take measures for defence and turned its attention
to the militia. It is only in war-time that Congress can be
induced to notice the citizen-soldiers. A law was passed
May 9, 1794, directing the states to organize active regiments
of militia and to prepare for eventualities. No action
seems to have resulted from this first legislation; and as the
foreign danger intensified, a second act was passed in 1797,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
aiming to render the former law effective. Following the
classical preferences of the times, the U. S. army had been
rechristened, in 1792, the “legion.” Each state must now
organize a “legion” of its own. 80,000 was the figure set for
the total strength of this force; and it is significant of Massachusetts’
relative standing that the Commonwealth was
directed to furnish 11,885 of the total&mdash;more than any other
state.</p>

<p>Massachusetts, on June 6, 1794, directed commanders of
train-band divisions to draft men from their brigades who
should hold themselves in instant readiness for service, as
the “minute-men” of 1775 had been selected and organized.
The great prestige of George Washington, for he had consented
to waive his seniority and to serve as Lieut.-General
under Pres. Adams, helped to render this revival of the
minute-men popular, and the fashionable designation of
“legion” did not detract from its popularity.</p>

<p>On August 22, 1797, a supplementary order was issued,
directing that a special regiment of such “legionaries” should
be formed from the militia of each division. The number of
divisions having increased to ten, this called for ten regiments
of active troops in Massachusetts and Maine.</p>

<p>While the order ostensibly affected the entire Commonwealth,
in point of fact the only legionaries ever organized
were in Boston. Brig.-Gen. John Winslow, a soldier of energy
and ability, in civil life a hardware dealer, was commissioned
to command the “legionary brigade” of Boston,
and during the ten years of his incumbency the legion was
so vital a factor in the city’s military life that it became a
fixture. Winslow’s legionary brigade was organized in 1799,
just as the war scare subsided. It consisted of legionary
cavalry (one troop), a sub-legion of light infantry made up
of two independent companies (the Fusiliers and the Boston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Light Infantry), and a sub-legion of artillery made up
of the Boston and Columbian companies, now fully organized
as a battalion under Maj. Daniel Wild. The Roxbury
and Dorchester companies did not join the legion, and now
completed a battalion organization under Maj. James Robinson
and were designated the “Battalion of Artillery, 1st
Brigade, 1st Division.” These two battalions, one within
and the other without the legion, represent a splitting up of
the 1789 battalion. On June 4, 1844, these two battalions,
numbered 1st (the legionary) and 2d (the old 1st Brigade
battalion) were to consolidate in the 5th Regiment of
Artillery.</p>

<p>The legionary brigade lasted as long as Gen. Winslow
continued in command. Its cavalry, light infantry and artillery
sections continued to thrive; and in 1802, under the
energetic leadership of Lt. Col. Robert Gardner, succeeded
in 1804 by Thomas Badger, a regiment, consisting of three
sub-legions of infantry, each commanded by a major, came
into existence. In the artillery sub-legion, Maj. Wild was
succeeded by Maj. John Bray in 1803, and by Maj. O.
Johonnot in 1805. Meanwhile the 1st Brigade battalion of
artillery was commanded by Maj. Robinson. In 1808 Gen.
Winslow retired; and in 1809 the legionary brigade was redesignated
“3d Brigade, 1st Division.” Its three sub-legions
of infantry became three infantry regiments, and these, as
we shall see, contained companies destined later to form
part of the Coast Artillery. The sub-legion of artillery
became known as the “Battalion of Artillery, 3d Brigade,”
commanded by Maj. Johonnot, in 1812 by Maj. Nathan
Parker, and in 1813 by Maj. William Harris. Maj. James
Robinson was succeeded as commander of the 1st Brigade
battalion by Maj. John Robinson in 1812, and the latter in
1814 by Maj. Isaac Gale, formerly Captain of the Roxbury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Artillery. The 3d Brigade rendered one distinguished service
to the city of Boston&mdash;it brought out and maintained
Asa Fillebrown as leader of the brigade band. The 3d Brigade
continued to be the most prominent element in Boston’s
militia until the reorganization of 1840.</p>

<p>No doubt the French war-scare and the formation of the
legionary brigade stimulated militia development in Massachusetts.
The Columbian Artillery, the 6th Company, was
organized June 17, 1798; and the Washington Artillery, the
7th Company, on May 29, 1810. Happily the war clouds
dissolved without doing serious damage to America. Meanwhile
the two battalions of artillery turned out to greet and
receive President John Adams on the occasion of his visit
to Boston.</p>

<p>Between the years of 1810 and 1819 and intermittently
until 1855, Massachusetts state rosters contain a curious
entry, “The Soul of the Soldiery.” While one could scarcely
guess the fact, this was a predecessor of the modern “training
school” for officers, and was maintained by the non-commissioned
officers of all companies connected with the
Legionary or 3d Brigade. No wonder that the Massachusetts
militia excelled the corresponding force in other states,
with such a spirit stirring the breasts of the enlisted men.</p>

<p>By 1812 America did find itself involved in actual war.
Statesmen had been laboring, and laboring successfully, for
nearly a score of years to keep us at peace with France.
Meanwhile circumstances conspired to stir up hostilities with
France’s great enemy; and almost before men could realize
the possibility of such a thing, we were engaged in the second
war with England.</p>

<p>This is no place to discuss the cause of the struggle;
Boston’s artillery companies shared the sentiment of their
section and regretted the condition of affairs. The war was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
unpopular in New England. But the members of the artillery
companies, being soldiers, did “not reason why” and
did put themselves into an attitude of preparedness.</p>

<p>Weeks ensued which men would be glad to forget. Regiments
of regulars were enlisted in Boston and transported
to the Canadian frontier as part of the successive invading
forces. After the lapse of months word came back of
American defeat, of the incompetence displayed by untrained
American officers, of hundreds of British putting
to flight thousands of Americans. Boston itself lay open to
hostile attack, with fortifications mostly in ruins, and such
as there were, ungarrisoned. Then came the naval victories
won by our gallant frigates, and Massachusetts breathed
more freely. The enthusiasm which was craving an opportunity
for expression found vent in ovations to victorious
sailors. During the first two years of hostilities no attack
was made against the New England coast, and we now know
that England deliberately refrained because of the friendly
sentiments of the New England people.</p>

<p>The year 1814 brought a great change in the situation.
England had downed Napoleon, and was at liberty to employ
her <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'mammouth'">mammoth</ins> resources in dealing with enemies elsewhere.
Massachusetts, because it was part of America, and
more particularly because its harbors served as a base of
operations for the American navy, was to feel the consequences
of war. Invasion commenced in Maine and threatened
to roll southward down the coast; immunity was at
an end; and an attack was actually made on Gloucester.
Gov. Caleb Strong waited as long as he dared, expecting the
Federal Government to take the steps necessary for defending
our coast. When it finally became evident that Washington
had its hands full elsewhere and could do nothing for
Boston, Gov. Strong acted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>As the service was to be guard duty and the erecting
of fortifications, and was likely to continue thru an indefinite
number of months, larger units of the militia were
not called out as such. No regiment went as a whole. It
seemed better to draft companies, platoons, and even squads.
A guard was maintained at Chelsea bridge to keep off raiding
parties. After Sept. 8, 1814, all militia organizations
were held in readiness; and between that date and November,
when the British fleet finally sailed away, every member
of the five artillery companies gave some weeks to active
service. Fort Independence on Castle Island and Fort
Warren on Governor’s Island, small works of brick and
earth, constituted Boston’s principal defences; these were
garrisoned, and put in repair. How tremendously modern
ordnance out-ranges that of a century ago! The present
Fort Warren, on Georges Island, erected in 1850, is today
not nearly far enough from the city it defends, not far
enough out at sea; neither is its armament as long-ranged
as it should be. Yet contrasted with the earlier Fort Warren,
it is very remote from Boston, and is armed with guns
able to do execution at almost infinite distance. The Commonwealth
added to the defences of the harbor; land was
purchased on Jeffries Point, East Boston, and another fort
erected to support Independence and Warren. The legislature,
out of compliment to the Governor, named the new
work Fort Strong. Here too one must be careful not to
confuse the old fort with that of the same name today on
Long Island.</p>

<p>Historians agree in pronouncing the militia a failure in
the second war with England. It must be confessed that
there is much ground for such a verdict; in fact, the regular
army was also, for the most part, a sad failure in the
same war. But in all fairness an exception should be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of the Massachusetts militia which manned the coast defences
of Boston and kept the British fleet outside the harbors
of the state. The Roxbury Artillerymen and their comrades
in sister companies were prompt in responding,
efficient in “digging” and other military labor, and entirely
vigilant in guard duty. Their service in 1814 goes far to
render the name of militia honorable.</p>

<p>One moment of relaxation came during the war when the
battalions paraded in Boston as escort to President James
Madison.</p>

<p>The year 1815 marked a turning point in American military
history, and the artillery companies of Boston felt its
influence. Danger from foreign foes was at an end; the
Indians were then so far to the westward as no longer to
be a serious menace. America felt free to enter upon a
career of peaceful conquest&mdash;and to get rich. It is fair to
note that England also began a similar stage at the same
time; perhaps there was some reflex influence exerted by
the mother country. The first symptom of the change was
the decay of the train-band. Whereas militia service had
hitherto been regarded seriously, as the most important duty
of citizenship, now men laughed at it. We begin to find
reference to the “corn-stalk” militia.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i037.jpg" width="600" height="374" alt="" />
<span class="smcap">The Train-Band, 1832. Why it was Abolished</span>
</div>

<p>Decay was gnawing at the vitals of the train-band system.
Ridiculous cartoons may be seen in the museum of the A. &amp;
H. Art. Co. (Matthews’ “Militia Folk” and others) showing
what a farce the institution had become. Men attended
muster in outrageously improper clothing, armed with
sticks, pitchforks, or nothing at all, and obviously treated
this aspect of their patriotic duty as a gigantic bit of buffoonery.
Quarterly training or muster-day became an occasion
more noted for the rum then consumed than for the
drilling done. Early temperance societies recognized this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
state of affairs by including in their abstinence pledges an
exception in favor of muster-day; it was not “intemperate”
to be drunk then. In our forefathers’ opinion this gradual
abandonment of compulsory universal military service was
regarded as a mark of social progress. Will such be the
ultimate verdict of history?</p>

<p>Increased importance attached to the Roxbury Artillery
and other volunteer companies as the train-band became increasingly
inactive. Let us inspect them, bearing in mind
that they are now the chief military reliance of the Commonwealth.
Discipline, judged by modern standards, may not
have been strict. Men came and went pretty much at will.
But they had some discipline, while their fellow-citizens did
not know what the word meant. No “basic course for officers”
as yet existed, and it is a fact that the higher officers
were apt to be chosen more for political than military reasons.
As the rank increased, the military attainments were
apt to diminish; but amongst the company officers were
found many brave and skilful soldiers. Uniform fashions
had been modified by the recent war&mdash;now companies wore
the shako on the head, at first of leather and later of bearskin,
the high buttoned swallow-tail coat, white webbing
cross-belts with brass breast-plates, and long trousers. Each
company had a distinctive uniform of its own, as different
as possible from all others; and this diversity persisted even
down until after the Civil War. It was a column of companies,
and judging from appearances, of extremely “separate”
companies, that paraded to escort and welcome
Lafayette in April and again on August 30, 1824; and to lay
the corner-stone of Bunker Hill monument in 1825; and
to inter President John Adams in July, 1826; and for the
funeral of Gov. William Eustis. An enthusiastic reception
was accorded by these companies to President Andrew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Jackson, June 24, 1833. These soldiers may not have been
as efficient as modern troops must be; but they made a
splendid appearance on parade; and beyond question were
a powerful military asset when judged by the standard of
their own times.</p>

<p>An attempt was made to increase efficiency by issuing
books of drill regulations available for all, instead of depending
upon oral instruction. In the earliest days drill was
regulated by Prussian and French systems of tactics. The
first book of tactics ever prepared in English for general
popular issue was written and published in 1813 by Gen.
Isaac Maltby of the Massachusetts militia, for the use of
Massachusetts troops. The necessity for conciseness and
speed was not then recognized. For a battalion to pass
from line to close column, the drill regulations of 1911 indicate
commands as follows: “Close on first company,
March, Second company, Squads right, column half right,
March.” Under Maltby’s system this was heard: “Battalions
will form close column of platoons on the right, in
rear of the first platoon, Shoulder arms, Battalion, Form
close column of platoons in rear of the right, Right face,
March.” Scott’s famous tactics were adopted in 1834.</p>

<p>Maj. Joseph E. Smith succeeded to the command of the
3d Brigade battalion of artillery in 1817, Maj. Thomas J.
Lobnell in 1823, Maj. Samuel Lynes in 1826, Maj. Aaron
Andrews in 1830, and Maj. Horace Bacon of Cambridge in
1832. By June 29, 1834, the battalion had grown to four
companies, and was for a year elevated to the dignity of a
regiment. John L. White, the popular proprietor of the
Union House (29 Union St.), was made Colonel, and thus
became the first man ever to hold that rank in the Coast
Artillery. Col. White’s military career had been meteoric; in
1831 he was elected Cornet (2d Lt.) of Light Dragoons in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the 3d Brigade; 1832 saw him Major of the 1st Infantry in
the same brigade; in 1834 he became Colonel of that regiment;
and ten weeks later, on the date given above, he
transferred and was commissioned Colonel of the new artillery
regiment. However the time was not yet ripe for regimental
dignity. When a few months later Col. White
removed from Boston and resigned his command, the organization
was allowed to slip back and again become a
battalion. Maj. John Hoppen commanded in 1836. On
April 24, 1840, the battalion was awarded the number “1st.”
In 1841 William B. Perkins was elected Major, the last man
to command it as a separate organization.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the 1st Brigade battalion was commanded by
the following Majors: 1818 Joseph Hastings of Roxbury,
1822 Robert Stetson of Dorchester (an ex-Captain of the
1st Company), 1825 John Parks of Dorchester, and 1829
Jonathan White, Jr., of Weymouth. In 1831 the strength
of the battalion was reduced from three to two companies,
and these were temporarily attached to an infantry regiment
(the 1st of the 1st Brigade). On June 26, 1834, the
battalion organization was restored, a new company having
been formed, with John Webber, an ex-Captain of the 1st
Company as Major. Maj. John W. Loud of Weymouth
was elected to command in 1836, and Maj. Webber again
in 1839. On April 24, 1840, the battalion was numbered
“2d.” In 1841 Samuel F. Train of Roxbury was elected
Major, the last man to command the battalion as a separate
organization. Capt. John Webber was succeeded as commander
of the 1st Company by Andrew Chase, Jr., a man
destined to become first Colonel of the new regiment. That
year the battalions paraded in celebration of the completion
of Boston’s new railroad.</p>

<p>All the companies were called out June 11, 1837, to maintain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
public order at the time of the Broad Street riot. The
outbreak arose from a clash between a funeral procession
and a fire-engine company. Which ought to have the right
of way? Unfortunately racial jealousy was present to embitter
the rivalry, so that blows were exchanged and a general
fire-alarm “rung in” and disorder became wide-spread.
First honors on this occasion belong to the newly organized
National Lancers, whose horses terrified the rioters; infantry
and artillery companies acted as reserve, and subsequently
policed the district.</p>

<p>This period of Corps history came to its conclusion when
on March 24, 1840, the legislature voted a general reorganization
of the militia, and in particular disbanded the ancient
train-band. In theory, the members of the artillery battalions
had been excused from the compulsory drill done by
every able-bodied man in their districts on the ground that
they were rendering more than the prescribed military service
in their volunteer organizations. In fact, the district
companies and regiments of the train-band had long since
ceased to do any true drilling and were little more than a
mere name. Courage is required to abate a long-standing
abuse. New York continued to endure the train-band system
until 1862, well into the Civil War. Massachusetts
faced the condition with greater determination, and abolished
the system in 1840. On March 24 the law was enacted,
and on April 17 the necessary orders issued. Thereafter
the volunteer companies were the only military force existing
in the Commonwealth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>1840-1861</h3>


<p>Gen. William Henry Harrison had been elected President
in 1840 at the conclusion of one of the most exciting political
contests ever known in America. A month after assuming
office, in April, 1841, he suddenly died. Public feeling which
had been so stirred over the election, now reacted; and men
everywhere vied with one another in expressing heart-felt
sorrow. Amidst circumstances of deep gloom, intensified
by bad weather, the battalions, in the very midst of the confusion
attendant upon their reorganization, made a funeral
parade notable for its sadness. It was not until July, 1862,
that the regiment again came in touch with Harrison; then
they were stationed at his birthplace, Harrison’s Landing
on the James River, Virginia. And greatly did they enjoy
their days of rest after the torture of the Chickahominy
swamp, and the opportunity to use plenty of clean, fresh
water for bathing; possibly some of the older soldiers
remembered the obsequies of April 22, 1841.</p>

<p>June, 1843, was a red-letter period in Boston history.
Bunker Hill monument was at last completed after eighteen
years building, and a vast concourse of people assembled
for its dedication. The New York 7th Regiment, then
known as the “National Guard Battalion,” arrived on the
16th, and was received and entertained by the Fusiliers.
Indeed troops were present from four outside states&mdash;Maine,
New Hampshire, Rhode Island and New York. That
same day the artillery battalions met President John Tyler
at Roxbury Crossing, and escorted him to the Tremont<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
House, the parade taking place amidst a drenching rain-storm.
The morning of the 17th was clear, cool, and delightful.
At an early hour, the military part of the procession,
which consisted of four grand divisions, was formed
on Boston Common. As the procession moved toward
Bunker Hill, the enthusiasm which was produced by the
admirable appearance of the troops was only equalled by
that which greeted the distinguished Webster, the gifted
orator of the day; while President Tyler, in melancholy contrast,
was received with ominous silence and coolness.
Arriving at Bunker Hill, the orator of the day and the guests
and officials passed into the already crowded square. While
Webster was speaking, the soldiers were necessarily far
beyond the sound of his voice, and were entertained by “a
bountiful collation,” which the hospitable authorities of
Boston had prepared. After the ceremonies, oratorical and
gustatory, the procession returned to Boston, and the troops
were reviewed by the President at the State House. At a
dinner the same evening in Faneuil Hall, President Tyler
gave the following toast:&mdash;“The Union,&mdash;a union of purpose,
a union of feeling, the Union established by our
fathers.” A few years later, he was an active enemy of
that Union, which he had complimented in the most solemn
manner within the sacred walls of the Cradle of Liberty.</p>

<p>Boston’s division of the force, thereafter to be known as
the Massachusetts Volunteer Militia, paraded in two brigades,
with a total strength of 2,500 men. Incidentally we
might note that there were two other such divisions in the
state. Under the circumstances the 1st and 2d Battalions
of Artillery added to their already creditable reputation
and presented a fine appearance. There were five companies
in the two battalions, each consisting of a captain, two lieutenants,
four sergeants, four corporals, six gunners, six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
bombardiers, one drummer, one fifer, and sixty-four privates
or “matrosses.” Part of each company was armed, equipped
and drilled as infantry; but each company proudly exhibited
two bronze six-pounder cannon with limbers, and a
single caisson. The ordnance had increased in caliber since
1784, the change being made in 1840. The state prescribed
by law what manner of uniform the artillery companies
should wear. Inasmuch however as the members had to
purchase their own clothing without state assistance, and
since they were mostly interested in the glory of their own
companies, they were pardonable for regarding the regulation
state uniform as merely a point of departure from
which fancy might soar in devising distinctive costumes for
the company units. Caps, short jackets, and frock coats,
soon to become popularized as a result of the Mexican War,
were beginning to be in vogue.</p>

<p>The year 1844 marked a still more important step in the
development of the artillery battalions. Train-band companies
of each district had always been organized into regiments,
and the regiment was conceded to be the fundamental
unit in importance. It was the tactical unit, that is, the
troops maneuvered as regiments when in the presence of
an enemy. It was also the administrative unit, in the sense
that all records and reports centered at regimental headquarters.
In drill regulations, the regiment was called a battalion;
but no battalion could claim to be a regiment unless
it had approximately ten companies, and was commanded
by a colonel; one thousand was the membership standard.
In other words the regiment was the only complete battalion.
When the train-band ceased to be, the battalions of artillery
began to aspire after regimental dignity in the Volunteer
Militia. The 1st Battalion had actually been a regiment for
a few months, ten years previously. Nor was it forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
that the two battalions were originally one, that the regimental
consolidation to be was really a reunion of those
who, forty-six years before, had been a single body. On
June 4, 1844, their wish was gratified; and the 5th Regiment
of Artillery came into being. With the promotion on June
24 of Andrew Chase, Jr., to the colonelcy the new organization
was completed.</p>

<p>Economy reigned in the Adjutant General’s office of that
day, and the state did not feel that it could afford much
expenditure for printing. Our earliest rosters come from
1858, and we are unable to name many of the distinguished
men who made up the 5th Regiment at its inception. It
contained five companies: 1st, the Roxbury Artillery; 4th,
the Dorchester Artillery; 6th, the Columbian Artillery; 7th,
the Washington Artillery; and 8th, the Boston Artillery.
Since all excepting the Dorchester company were strong
organizations with established reputations, the regiment,
from the very beginning, became the most distinguished
military body in the city and state. In recognition of this
fact Col. Chase was promoted to the brigadier-generalship
Aug. 28, 1847.</p>

<p>Military affairs were stimulated by the Mexican war in
1846. While no militia organization went from Massachusetts,
individuals from all regiments enlisted in the 1st Massachusetts
Volunteers, the single regiment sent out by the
state; and tales of American valor in the southwest served
to arouse all to do better work. Mexican veterans afterward
organized a company in our command; and became the
recognized custodians of the 1st Volunteers’ Mexican battle-flag.</p>

<span class="smcap">Artillery in 1784</span>
</div>

<p>Regimental responsibility was too much for the Dorchester
Artillery, and it was disbanded in 1845. Only four
companies remained in the 5th Regiment. In fact there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
was too much disbanding <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'for good'">for the good</ins> of the militia. The
state authorities seemed to think that it was cheaper to disband
a company which had fallen into “hard luck” than it
was to cure the difficulty by paying a little money for the
restoration and support of the sufferer. This was a false
economy. Of the one hundred forty-two companies which
existed in 1840 in the new Volunteer Militia, seventy-eight
were disbanded within the first seven years, and one hundred
two passed out of existence within twenty-five years.
With so many surgical operations it is marvelous that any
militia survived at all.</p>

<p>Altho few in number, the four companies of the 5th Regiment
who paraded as an escort to President Polk June 29,
1847, and who welcomed Daniel Webster upon his return
to Boston, gave evidence of increased efficiency. The legislature
was making more liberal appropriations&mdash;was indeed
spending each year (1844-1852) all of $6 per man on the
militia; even this moderate expenditure was far better than
nothing. The state authorities were very well satisfied with
themselves and with their handiwork, reporting to inquirers
that the Massachusetts system “met every need.” A fairly
liberal allowance of ammunition was made to each artillery
company&mdash;forty round shot, forty canister, and one hundred
pounds of powder every year.</p>

<p>William B. Perkins became Colonel Sept. 10, 1847. Altho
he did not enjoy good physical health, and died in office
November 16, 1849, his administration was signalized by
several important events. On March 10, 1848, occurred
the funeral of Ex-President John Quincy Adams. The
regiment, or part of it, paraded on Oct. 25 of the same year
in celebration of the completion of the Cochituate water
system. On Aug. 8 and 9, 1849, the regiment participated
in its first state camp, at Neponset, continuing two and one-half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
days. A curious old print of this encampment has
come down to us showing how the 1st Brigade of the 1st
Division looked at the time. The 5th Artillery was present,
four companies strong, clad conspicuously in bearskin and
other towering shakos; the balance of the brigade consisted
of the National Lancers in their uhlan costumes, as
at present, which had been adopted four years before, and
the 1st Light Infantry, wearing distinctive company uniforms.
The Lancers were at that time attached to the 1st
Light Infantry, and were the only cavalry command in the
state. Was any prophet present in Neponset on those August
days gifted with ability to read the future? Did anyone
even guess that twenty-nine years later the 5th Artillery
and the remnant of the 1st Light Infantry were to consolidate
in a new 1st Regiment? While a two and one-half day
camp must necessarily be chiefly occupied with pitching
tents, escorting visitors, engaging in those social festivities
which are “absolutely essential” on all military occasions,
and then taking down the tents, there is no doubt that the
men acquired much real military knowledge in between-times,
and that the new custom registered a long step
forward.</p>

<p>Col. Asa Law commanded the regiment from Jan. 4 to
July 10, 1850.</p>

<p>July 26, 1850, witnessed another change in the colonelcy,
Robert Cowdin assuming command of the regiment. Col.
Cowdin, in his peaceful moments, was a Boston lumber-dealer;
but members of the regiment will always remember
him as a soldier, except when they recall some more intimate
contact with the man whom they loved; then they speak of
him as “father.” It makes a great deal of difference that
he commanded them during the year of fearful hardship
and sanguinary strife on the Virginia Peninsula; but even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
before that he had endeared himself to his men, while he
was merely a militia commander. He had been Captain of
Co. K, in the 1st Inf. during 1848 and 1849; and came into
the artillery as Major. It is hardly over-stating it, to say
that Col. Cowdin is the man who made the regiment great.</p>

<p>What he assumed command over was actually four splendid
artillery companies, loosely yoked together in the 5th
Regiment. The conception was nine-tenths “company” and
only one-tenth “regiment.” Inter-company rivalry had prevented
the development of real regimental spirit. The new
colonel was determined to command a true regiment; and
since he was a man of masterly force and boundless enthusiasm,
he speedily had his way. Distinctive company costumes
yielded place to a regimental uniform, and thereafter
the company was a subordinate unit. The obsequies of Ex-President
Taylor were the last occasion on which inter-company
diversity appeared; and that was in the very month
of Col. Cowdin’s accession. In all his reforms he was ably
seconded by Capt. Moses H. Webber of Roxbury, commanding
the 1st Company. In 1851 percussion muskets
displaced the flint-locks. The same year a new 4th Company,
the Cowdin Artillery, was organized, followed in
1852 by the 9th Company, the Webster Artillery, and in
1853 by the 3d Company or Bay State Artillery and the 5th
Company or Shields Artillery. The regiment thus had eight
companies. That year Isaac S. Burrell became Captain of
the 1st Company.</p>

<p>Col. Cowdin’s first camp was held at Medford, and drew
warm compliments from the Adjutant General. Neponset
was occupied as a camp-ground for the second time in 1851;
Boston Common in 1852; and the regiment participated in
divisional camp at North Abington in 1853. In 1854 the
division was at Quincy. How conditions have changed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the increase of Massachusetts population! Who would
think of these places as suitable camp-sites today, least of
all, Boston Common?</p>

<p>Col. Cowdin’s regiment paraded as escort to President
Fillmore Sept. 17, 1851; they helped welcome the Hungarian
patriot, Louis Kossuth, April 27, 1852; and they participated
in the funeral parade for Daniel Webster in
Marshfield, Nov. 30, 1852. It came to be a custom at this
time for Boston military critics and newspaper reporters
to accord chief praise, after a parade, to the 5th Regiment.</p>

<p>Anthony Burns’ name is associated with the next important
event in the regiment’s history, the most unpleasant
event with which it ever had anything to do. No more
painful duty can confront the militiaman than the task of
maintaining public order, for no American likes to have
part in coercing his fellow citizens. And on June 2, 1854,
the regiment was called upon to enforce the most unpopular
statute ever enacted by Congress, the “Fugitive Slave” law.
Burns had escaped from his owner in Virginia, and found
employment with a Boston clothing-dealer. Massachusetts
was called upon to render him up under the terms of the
new statute, and the U. S. Marshal arrested him on May 25.
Public sympathy was strongly with the colored man, funeral
draperies appeared upon the fronts of private residences,
many threatened mob violence, and a great popular meeting
was held in Faneuil Hall, May 27, addressed by Wendell
Phillips and other prominent anti-slavery men, to protest
against this humiliation to which Massachusetts was about
to submit. The speakers even counseled a rescue by force.
Under the U. S. law, a man “held to service” in another state,
could be extradited and transported to that state for trial.
The trouble was, that in the case of a fugitive slave, extradition
involved the entire question&mdash;if Burns should be carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
back to Virginia, his chance of liberty would be gone;
and Boston believed in liberty. An attempt was made to
take him from jail, but this proved unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Col. Cowdin’s 5th Regiment, Col. Holbrook’s 1st Regiment,
the 3d Battalion, the Cadets and the Lancers were
ordered out to assist the police in enforcing the law.
Guards were posted along the streets leading from the
court-house to the “T Wharf,” where a steamer lay in
readiness; and the Lancers, with a strong detachment of
police, and U. S. artillery, surrounded the prisoner. It was
on June 2 that the U. S. Commissioner rendered his decision;
and the grim procession started at once. Red pepper
and acid were thrown at the troops, clubs and stones were
used, a Lancer’s horse was stabbed; but the display of force
proved too strong for the rioters.</p>

<p>Both Col. Cowdin and Col. Holbrook later proved the
genuineness of their devotion to freedom’s cause by commanding
regiments in the Civil War. What they and their
commands did on June 2, 1854, was entirely distasteful to
them; but the call came to them as soldiers. Like true soldiers
they performed their duty; and Burns went back to the
south. His fidelity to duty was eight years later to be instrumental
in preventing the confirmation of Col. Cowdin’s
appointment as Brigadier General.</p>

<p>Happily, with the modern increase in police efficiency
occasions for such service grow less and less frequent. Our
professional police officers are now capable of handling all
but the most severe crises without military assistance.</p>

<p>Another state-wide reorganization of the militia was engineered
by the legislature on Feb. 26, 1855; and in some
ways this was the most unfortunate of them all. It was
primarily caused by racial and sectarian jealousy, a spirit
which has no rightful place whatever in American life. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
principles of the “Know Nothing” party were regnant that
year. No less a man than Thomas Cass was forced to resign
his military commission&mdash;today his statue stands in
honor in the Public Gardens. It almost seemed that the
dominant faction were determined to prove themselves in
the military and other diverse fields, as well as in the field
of partizan politics, to be “know nothings.” The 5th Regiment,
Boston’s best, was ordered disbanded; but the State
House authorities did not really mean this. They only reorganized
the command, with the intention that the resultant
“2d Regiment of Infantry” should continue its service
record. The 6th Company, the old Columbian Artillery
commanded by Cass, together with the Webster Artillery
and Shields Artillery of the 5th, were actually disbanded.
Worst of all, Col. Cowdin found his commission vacated,
apparently for political reasons. Capt. Cass’s company continued
its existence as the “Columbian Association,” and
in 1861 developed into the 9th Infantry.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 403px;">

<a href="#Page_99">Page 99</a>
</div>

<p>Moses H. Webber was commissioned Colonel of the new
2d Infantry on April 18, 1855, and continued in office until
Dec. 19 of that year. It consequently fell to his lot to adapt
the regiment to its new conditions. Since the regiment had
been drilling more and more as infantry and less and less
as artillery, the change from one branch of the service to
the other was less abrupt than it appeared to be. And be it
noted that the regiment never lost interest in its native artillery&mdash;until
in 1897 it re-entered the artillery branch. Col.
Webber had four companies from the 5th, three of them old
and strong ones. Two companies were transferred from
the 1st Regiment, the 6th and 9th, of which both were already
distinguished under their names, the “Union Guards” and
the “National Guards.” The artillery companies signalized
their transition to infantry by changing their names, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Roxbury Artillery becoming the Roxbury City Guard, the
Washington Artillery the Washington Light Guard, and
the Boston Artillery the Boston Phalanx. The regiment,
so reorganized, was paraded by Col. Webber as escort to
President Franklin Pierce, when the latter visited Boston.</p>

<p>As the Civil War approached, Massachusetts grew more
liberal in providing for her soldiers. In 1852 the expenditure
per man was increased to $6.50 a year, in 1857 to $9.00,
and in 1858 the expenditure was fixed at $7.50 and remained
there until 1869.</p>

<p>The New York 7th Regiment visited Boston and participated
in the Bunker Hill celebration of June 17, 1857.
Their ease and precision of movement, their evident regimental
spirit, their large numbers, and their serviceable yet
dressy gray uniform, worn uninterruptedly since 1824,&mdash;all
made a deep impression upon Boston military men. As the
7th had stopped to suppress an incipient riot on its way to
the boat in New York the night before, its practical efficiency
added force to the impression. The Lancers and
the 2d, who acted as special escort to the visiting troops,
came most strongly under this spell. An impulse was given
to the movement for improving the 2d. In 1859 the regiment
adopted a gray uniform closely patterned after the
dress of the 7th, and continued the new bill of dress until
July, 1861. Again after the war the same gray uniform
was in use between 1869 and 1880.</p>

<p>Col. William W. Bullock commanded the regiment from
Jan. 11, 1856, until April 14, 1858, when he was promoted
to be Brigadier General. Camp was held at Quincy in 1856;
at Chelsea in 1857; and the latter occasion was notable because
Robert Cowdin then rejoined his old command, accepting
the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.</p>

<p>In 1858 (May 11) Col. Cowdin was again in command;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and continued in office until the second year of the war,
when on Sept. 26, 1862, he was advanced to the rank of
Brigadier General. In connection with the regimental camp
at North Bridgewater, 1858, the regiment received its long-desired
rifled muskets.</p>

<p>So many companies had been transferred from the old
1st Regiment, that it finally seemed best to disband that
organization altogether. By contrast with the 5th-2d, its
regimental spirit had grown weaker and weaker with each
passing year until Boston’s oldest regiment was nothing but
a loosely connected group of separate companies. So on
March 1, 1859, four of its companies, the Washington
Guards, the Independent Boston Fusiliers, the Pulaski
Guards and the Mechanic Rifles, were transferred to Col.
Cowdin’s regiment, where they took place as the 2d, 3d, 4th
and 5th Companies respectively. As separate companies
these already possessed proud records; and in their new
regimental connection the 3d and 4th immediately found a
vigorous new life. The Mechanic Rifles soon disbanded, and
most of the members joined the Ancient and Honorable
Artillery Company. Later on, we shall follow the adventures
of the three remaining companies of the old 1st.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Massachusetts was getting ready for the approaching
war and putting her military forces in condition
for active service. Sept. 7 to 9, 1859, Col. Cowdin led his
reinforced command to camp at Concord, winning highest
praise for the numbers and skill of his men. This was a
notable occasion in Massachusetts military history, and as it
later proved, in U. S. history. Had not the Bay State been
more ready for war than her sisters, there would have been
no “minute-men of ’61” available to rush southward, and
save the National capital. The Concord encampment for
the entire Volunteer Militia, three divisions with a total<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
membership of 7,500 men, was the pet project of Gov.
Nathaniel Banks. While other executives of the state had
regarded their office of commander-in-chief as a somewhat
perfunctory affair, Gov. Banks took it exceedingly seriously;
and even went so far as to uniform himself in clothing
appropriate to his military office. Surely he “came to the
kingdom for such a time as this.” While the pacifist governors
of many northern states were ridiculing the very idea
of war, Gov. Banks put his state in an attitude of preparedness&mdash;and
was largely instrumental in saving the Union.</p>

<p>As the encampment continued only three days, it was
mainly occupied with making and breaking camp, and escorting
distinguished official visitors. But some little time was
squeezed out for studying the new Hardee’s tactics, which
were just supplanting Scott’s. Great enthusiasm was
aroused by the presence of Gen. John E. Wool, the “hero
of Buena Vista,” who reviewed the troops. But the great
day of all came when Gov. Banks and the members of the
legislature reviewed the campers. A famous lithograph of
this scene exists; and does more than anything else to make
the regiment of those days seem real to us. Numbers were
small, as we reckon numbers today; but the finest spirit of
determined patriotism was manifest.</p>

<p>A slight change in organization took place under Hardee’s
tactics; instead of four lieutenants to a company, there
were only two. Consequently few new men were elected
to fill vacancies until the regiment had adjusted itself to the
new régime. The officers of the regiment at the great Concord
encampment, besides Col. Cowdin, were: Lieutenant
Colonel, Isaac S. Burrell (postmaster of Roxbury, and later
City Marshal); Major, Isaac F. Shephard. The captains
commanding companies were: 1st, Thomas L. D. Perkins
(proprietor of a smoke-house); 3d, Henry A. Snow (treasurer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of a bleachery); 6th, Edward Pearl; 7th, Walter S.
Sampson (a mason and builder); 8th, Clark B. Baldwin (a
merchant); 9th, Arthur Dexter; and 10th, Joshua Jenkins.
With the Civil War less than two years off, it is well to look
ahead and see how many of these militiamen rendered service
in the hour of their country’s need. Of the Colonel
we have already spoken. The Lieutenant Colonel commanded
the 42d Regiment in 1862, and again in 1864, as we
shall see. The Major presently removed to Missouri for
business reasons, where he served with Nathaniel Lyon, and
ultimately commanded the 51st U. S. Colored Infantry, and
was promoted to be Brigadier General. Four of the seven
captains went to war. Capts. Snow and Pearl served three
months each at the beginning of the regiment’s three years
of service, and then received their discharges. Capt. Sampson
took his company into the 6th Regiment, and led them
thru Baltimore on April 19, 1862, under deadly fire from
the rioters. Later he served as Captain in the 22d Infantry
during the Peninsular campaign, commanding that regiment
at Gaines Mill. Capt. Baldwin remained in Col. Cowdin’s
regiment when his company transferred themselves to the
new 4th Battalion of Rifles and ultimately to the 13th Regiment;
and became commander of a new 4th Company, and
from 1862 to 1864 was Lieutenant Colonel of the regiment.
Baldwin was a most profane man, and during the ensuing
campaign stragglers could identify their regiment from a
distance by the sound of his swearing. When Baldwin was
made prisoner at the Wilderness, his captors marvelled at
his vocabulary; and came up to his tent in successive reliefs
to listen. Once a youthful fifer who had been caught by
the then Lieutenant Colonel straggling, was punished by
having a log loaded on his shoulder as he marched. This
lad has put on record, that regulations provided for “a field<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
officer at the head of a regiment and a mule at the rear”;
and that Col. Baldwin was deemed well-qualified for either
end of the column. But the testimony is confessedly biassed.</p>

<p>Boston Common was the site of the 1860 camp, the last
camp before the war. Military interest was then at fever
heat, and the very air seemed electric with the coming struggle.
In the midst of the warlike preparation occurred a
peaceful ceremony which gained in interest from its very
contrast with its surroundings; the youthful Prince of
Wales, afterward Edward VII of Great Britain, visited
Boston and was accorded military honors. A member of
the regiment has recorded of him that he was “a really
handsome youth with a pleasant blue eye, plump cheeks,
and skin of great fairness.”</p>

<p>On January 24, 1861, the 2d Regiment was redesignated,
receiving the number, “1st,” which had been taken away
from the old 1st in 1859. Since six companies of the old
1st (as well as Col. Cowdin himself) had previously been
added to what now became the “Civil War” 1st, there was
an obvious fitness in allowing the number to be transferred
also. Moreover the future held in store that all remaining
of the old 1st personnel should, in 1878, be consolidated with
their quondam comrades in a new 1st Regiment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>RESPONDING TO THE PRESIDENT’S CALL</h3>


<p>April, 1861, ended the suspense. Sumpter was fired upon
April 12. Lincoln’s first call for troops was issued April 15,
supplemented by a personal appeal from Senator Henry
Wilson&mdash;“Send on 1,500 men at once.” The militia mobilized
with marvelous rapidity on April 16, and started south
under command of Gen. Benjamin F. Butler the following
day, for three months’ service.</p>

<p>Those were days of tense feeling. A shipmaster who
displayed a southern flag was in danger of losing both his
life and his vessel; and ended by issuing profuse apologies.
Business firms made lavish gifts toward the equipment of
the regiments; indeed everyone seemed ready to give whatever
he had. All one needed to do was to appear in uniform
in order to be accounted a hero&mdash;much to the discomfort of
many genuinely modest men.</p>

<p>And thruout these opening days the 1st Regiment was
subjected to the very hardest test, in that nothing whatever
happened to them. They could not take comfort in the
knowledge that the 3d Regiment, one of the very earliest
to go, would by and by become consolidated with them, and
so share the honors which they were earning. All that the
members of the 1st could do was to hope, and growl, and
wonder why the Governor should select them for home-guard
purposes while he allowed others to go to war.</p>

<p>Then something actually did happen, which only served
to aggravate. Captain Sampson discovered a vacancy in
the 6th Regiment, and with Col. Cowdin’s approval promptly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
secured the transfer of his 7th Company, the Washington
Light Guard, one of the three strong artillery companies
which had come down from the very beginning of regimental
history; so that the 6th had a Co. K of which to be proud,
and the 1st Regiment had nothing. Co. K of the 6th, as was
to be expected, covered itself with glory during the street-fight
in Baltimore on April 19. Capt. David K. Wardwell,
whose company had suffered disbandment a few months
before, profited by his consequent independence and organized
a new company, with Col. Cowdin presiding at the election
of officers; and then took the new organization off with
the 5th Regiment as Co. F. “Wardwell’s Tigers” shared
in the laurels won by their regiment at Annapolis and
Washington, and three months later at Bull Run found
themselves fighting in the same army with the old 1st Regiment.
Meanwhile their success in getting into active service
did not make it any easier for the 1st Regiment to
endure the masterly inactivity of those April days.</p>

<p>Finally on April 27, the 1st Regiment was ordered to
prepare itself&mdash;as if it had not been prepared “right up to
the handle” for two weeks past. But, alas, instructions
came from the War Department that no more three-months
men were desired, and after fifteen days’ service by the
regiment, the order was, on May 7, revoked. Forty-two
years later the legislature passed a resolve according official
recognition to the 1st Regiment as having volunteered with
the other “minute men;” but this was no comfort whatever
to the eager young soldiers of 1861, who were told to lay
down their weapons and go home. Col. Cowdin and his
men were in high favor at the Boston City Hall; but owing
to their services at the Burns riot, and for other political
reasons, they were frowned on by Gov. Andrew and the
Senators.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>On second thought Col. Cowdin decided that he and his
men were going to get into active service in spite of all
difficulties. It had just become known that the Government
desired three-year regiments, and this opened a door of
possibility. The 1st would go to war for three years. To
be sure this was a plunge in the dark. Suppose the war
should not last three years&mdash;would the troops be kept in
service anyway? Moreover, there had never been any three-year
volunteers in the United States, during any previous
war; and it requires courage to set a precedent. But Col.
Cowdin and his men made the necessary readjustments demanded
by the prospect of prolonged absence from home,
and volunteered as a three-year regiment. Owing to their
promptness, they were able to win an honor greater even
than came to the “minute-men;” for they became the very
first long-term volunteer regiment to enter U. S. service
anywhere in the country, the first not only of the Civil War
but of any war. Their adventures, and the battles they
fought, are “another story”; and will be told in a later
chapter.</p>

<p>One of the three old original artillery companies having
been lost to the 6th, another was destined to go with&mdash;no,
the correct expression is, to “become”&mdash;the 13th Regiment.
Late in 1860 the 8th Company, the “Boston Artillery,”
became interested in organizing a “crack” battalion
or regiment for Boston. They were already members of
the best regiment in the Commonwealth, but they were not
satisfied with that. Capt. Baldwin did not share in this new
ambition and declined to have anything to do with it. In
civil life he was a merchant and wholly practical in his
tastes; as a soldier he was a plain, blunt man, “full of
strange oaths,” “who loved his friends.” The new departure
did not appeal to him. So Capt. Baldwin transferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to the 4th Company, the Pulaski Guards, and remained with
his old regiment; while the Boston Artillery chose Gen.
Samuel H. Leonard, recently of Worcester, as their captain.
Under Capt. Leonard the Boston Artillery absorbed what
survived of the disbanded Columbian Greys or City Guards
of the old 1st, and proceeded to expand into the 4th Battalion
of Rifles. It was on Dec. 15, 1860, that the new
battalion was formed. Before the enthusiastic officers and
men had time to do much toward developing their ideal of
a “crack” regiment, they found themselves upon the
threshold of the great war. On May 25, 1861, they volunteered
to garrison Ft. Independence for one month; and
almost before the month had expired, the 4th Battalion of
Rifles had expanded once more and become the 13th Regiment,
and on July 16 they were mustered in for three years’
service. Col. Cowdin’s men felt that they could well afford
to lose their grand old 8th Company, when their loss resulted
in the addition of an entire regiment to the Union
army. The 13th served as part of the first corps in the
army of Virginia, and later the army of the Potomac. Their
regimental monument stands on the field of their hardest
fight, that of the first day at Gettysburg, where they lost
their gallant corps commander, Gen. John F. Reynolds.
And on the second day of that battle, toward evening, they
were sent to reinforce Sickles on the left, in whose corps
was the 1st Massachusetts. Once more the Boston Artillery
and the Roxbury Artillery were serving side by side.</p>

<p>On May 18, 1861, just one week before the 1st was mustered
into Federal service, it lost another company. Capt.
Joseph H. Barnes had organized a new 7th Company to fill
the place made vacant by Capt. Sampson’s withdrawal. But
the example of his predecessor proved contagious; so that
presently the new company followed the old one. Capt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Barnes’ command joined the 4th Mass. Infantry at Fort
Monroe, and so found active work immediately. When,
however, the 4th presently came home, its new Co. K was
left behind, and became incorporated in the 29th Regiment,
with which it served three years. In 1862 the 29th was with
the army of the Potomac, in 1863 in Mississippi and Tennessee,
and again with the army of the Potomac in 1864.
Capt. Gardner Walker’s North End True Blues eventually
went with Col. Cowdin as the 7th Company.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Isaac S. Burrell was not able to accompany
his regiment in the three-years’ service. Remaining
in Boston with a few other members who were similarly
situated, he maintained a skeleton organization of the old
militia regiment. And because the new number, 1st, was
borne by Col. Cowdin, Col. Burrell had to hunt another
designation for his command. The fourteen officers and
two hundred sixteen men, in seven companies, who were
engaged in this home-guard duty were by no means satisfied
with their position. Their hearts were in Maryland and
Virginia with their former comrades.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1862 Banks was driven from the Shenandoah
valley and the north began to fear for the safety of
Washington. On May 26, in response to requests from the
Secretary of War, Massachusetts and other northern states
mobilized their militia, recruiting the regiments up as nearly
as possible to full strength. This alarm subsided presently.
But Pope’s defeat at second Bull Run, August 30, left the
capital in genuine peril, and caused a hasty call for 300,000
more troops, to serve nine months. Grave disaster had
overtaken the Union arms, and there was immediate need
for reinforcements. Col. Burrell was in militia camp at
Medford with his regiment when the call came; and at once
volunteered. Indeed this was just the chance for which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
they had been waiting&mdash;active duty but for a period not so
extended as three years.</p>

<p>Recruits were needed in order to bring the regiment up
to war strength. By some singular perversity, as soon as
recruiting began, a situation developed which threatened to
destroy the regiment entirely. Col. Burrell and Lt. Col.
Thomas L. D. Perkins were both graduates of the 1st Company,
Perkins having succeeded Burrell as captain. A bitter
jealousy had grown up in Perkins’ mind which made him
incapable of rendering loyal support to his chief. Maj.
George W. Beach shared Lt. Col. Perkins’ feeling and co-operated
in his insubordination. Needless to say, Col. Burrell
gave no real ground whatever for this feeling.</p>

<p>After the deadlock had continued for more than a month,
during which the regiment made little progress in filling its
ranks, Col. Burrell secured Gov. Andrew’s permission to
take strenuous measures. Another command, the 54th of
Worcester county, was similarly in need of men. The men
already belonging to the 42d (as Burrell’s command became
known, possibly with some reference to the proud record
made by the 42d or Black Watch Highlanders in the British
army) were consolidated into the 1st and 3d Companies;
new 7th and 10th Companies were formed in Boston and
Dorchester; 2d and 9th Companies were drawn from the
54th, while Boston, Medway and Weymouth provided units
for the four vacancies. Capt. George Sherive commanded
the 1st Company, Capt. George P. Davis the 2d (or Ware
Company), Capt. Alfred N. Proctor (a photographer, and
one of the indistinguishable “Proctor twins”) the 3d, Capt.
Charles A. Pratt the 4th, Capt. David W. Bailey the 5th,
Capt. Ira B. Cook the 6th (from Medway), Capt.
Orville W. Leonard (who had been a private in the 6th
Regiment during the ninety-days service) the 7th, Capt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Hiram S. Coburn the 8th (from Weymouth), Capt. John
D. Coggswell the 9th (of Leicester), and Capt. Cyrus
Savage the 10th or Dorchester Company. All the newer
elements proved to be congenial, the Worcester county men
being especially good soldiers, with the exception however
of the 5th Company. This unit was gathered in too much
of a hurry, contained a “tough” element, and was a constant
cause of discord. No one could then foresee that the regimental
number, 54th, released by the consolidation of companies
in the 42d, would presently be immortalized by Col.
Robert Gould Shaw’s heroic black men.</p>

<p>In accordance with law, the company officers proceeded
to elect regimental officers, and bestowed the chief honor
upon Col. Burrell. Perkins and Beach tried hard to prevent
this, but in vain; the electors were seeking the best soldier,
and cared nothing whatever for old jealousies. They proceeded
to select Joseph Stedman as Lt. Col. and Frederick
G. Stiles of Worcester as Major, thus retiring the disgruntled
former incumbents of those offices. A magnificent
stand of colors was presented to the command; and on Oct.
14, the 42d was finally mustered in.</p>

<p>Nothing out of the ordinary marked the railroad journey
to New York. But progress thereafter, which was by boat,
proved to be highly uncomfortable. The transports were
small, and not too seaworthy. And worse yet for “landlubbers,”
the sea was rough. It is said that the man establishing
his claim to possessing the strongest stomach was
the man whose digestive organ would throw the farthest.
As however all things have an end, the sufferers finally arrived
at the mouth of the Mississippi, and once more became
habitants of <i>terra firma</i>.</p>

<p>From the streets of Boston and the hills of Worcester
county to the canebrakes and swamps of Mississippi and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Louisiana is a violent transition, which nothing less tough
than the human system could endure. Yet the 42d Regiment
survived its journey to the department of the Gulf
and may almost be said to have flourished in its new environment.
Of course the heat was often prostrating, while
malaria took its toll of human life. The companies were
separated, and were assigned to provost and engineering
duty at different stations. Hard-tack and salt beef and pork
are not luxurious fare, muddy coffee (which means usually
coffee made with muddy water) is far from being a dainty
beverage, digging is a most unromantic occupation, and
even staying awake nights to watch while others sleep does
not arouse the finer emotions as much in fact as when set
forth by poets. Yet these are the staple elements of a soldier’s
life; and these the 42d enjoyed in abundant profusion.
Sensational details were lacking in this experience; but the
service is not the less a thing of which to be proud.</p>

<p>Col. Burrell with three of his Boston companies, the 1st,
3d, and 10th, were detached to garrison the port of Galveston,
Texas, and to co-operate with the Navy there. Of
all the 42d Regiment, these companies alone chanced to
find themselves “in the limelight.” The Galveston wharf
was to be kept available for Naval use; and in turn the
Navy was to shelter the garrison under the protection of its
guns. Witnesses disagree as to just how well the latter
work was performed. On Jan. 1, 1863, the Confederates
attacked in overwhelming numbers at a moment when, for
some reason, the warships had been withdrawn. Col. Burrell
and his men defended themselves heroically and took
heavy toll from the attackers. But with five thousand Confederates
against three hundred Union soldiers, the result
was inevitable. After the Confederates had brought thirty-one
pieces of artillery into action, Col. Burrell and his men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
surrendered themselves prisoners of war. Highly respected
because of their stubborn bravery, the men were soon exchanged;
and upon returning to the Union lines were accorded
an ovation. The officers were retained in captivity
longer; and Col. Burrell finally secured release just in season
to assume command of his old regiment during its next tour
of duty, that of the one hundred days. Other companies
of the 42d were in action at Port Hudson, Lafourche Crossing,
and Brashear City.</p>

<p>Disaster attended the return journey of the 42d. Going
by boat thru Long Island Sound, one of the transports, the
“Commodore,” struck a rock off Point Judith, and threatened
to founder. The troops had to be taken off in small
boats at much discomfort and no little peril, and finished
their journey in another craft. On August 20, 1863, the
men were finally mustered out, their nine months having
extended itself into almost a full year.</p>

<p>Now, returning, the 42d kept its place in the line of the
militia. Meanwhile unattached companies began to exist,
which in certain cases aimed to act as reserve or “depot”
companies for units of the 1st-42d. This was notably true
of the 2d, 3d, 5th, and 6th Companies. The 1st Regiment
was treading its bloody path of glory and approaching the
time when it would return to Massachusetts and home. It
disbanded upon its muster-out of the U. S. service, May 28,
1864; and many of its members were glad to join these reserve
companies and so keep up the cherished associations.</p>

<p>Again the need became urgent for more troops. Gen.
Grant, the new Lieut. Gen. and Commander-in-chief, had
assembled all available men for the reinforcement of his
mobile army in April, 1864, withdrawing so many of the
defenders of Washington as to leave the national capital
exposed to attack. In July such a raid was actually made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
under the vigorous leadership of Gen. Jubal A. Early; and
came uncomfortably near to succeeding. So a call was
issued for short-term volunteers who should garrison fortified
posts, and release the long-term men for active service.
All the “hurrah” spirit had gone out of the war by 1864&mdash;indeed
men were too weary to feel enthusiasm of any kind.
There is therefore something all the finer in the grim way
in which the 42d and the unattached companies responded
to this call.</p>

<p>Remarkable as it may seem, eight of the companies which
served during the nine months’ tour had retained their organization
sufficiently to respond a second time. As one
of those missing in 1864 was the “tough” 5th Company
(N. B., of Boston, not Chelsea) the task of recruiting the
needed units was not altogether an unwelcome one. Samuel
A. Waterman commanded the 1st Company, Benjamin R.
Wales the 2d, Alanson H. Ward (later a captain in the 61st
Inf.) the 3d, Augustus Ford (who had been 1st Sergeant
and 1st Lt. during the previous year) the 4th, George M.
Stewart the new 5th Company, Benjamin C. Tinkham (sergeant
during the nine-months’ service) the 6th, Isaac B.
White (1st Lt. the year previous) the 7th, Warren French
the new 8th, Samuel S. Eddy (a 2d Lt. in the 51st during
its nine months in North Carolina) the 9th, and James T.
Stevens (1st Lt. in the 4th Reg. during its three months in
1861) the 10th. The same field officers were in command.
The happiest rivalry existed between the Boston companies
and those from Worcester county, in their attempt each to
bring the largest numbers and finest personnel forward in
response to the new call. The old regimental colors were
again borne at the head of the revived regiment. Entering
Federal service on July 20, the regiment was assigned to
the defences of Washington, and stationed at Alexandria,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Virginia. Here they formed part of the “outer picket” of
the capital, and in addition furnished train-guards to protect
railroad transportation from Washington to the Shenandoah
Valley, the men detailed to service on the freight-cars
being the only members of the 42d coming under Confederate
fire during the present tour of duty. Col. Burrell came
back from his southern prison just in season to rejoin his
command at Alexandria. While the regiment had enlisted
for one hundred days, its service continued thirteen days
over time, and the men were mustered out Nov. 11.</p>

<p>There seemed to be unlimited reserves of vitality in
the 1st and 3d Companies&mdash;indeed one is reminded of the
way bees swarm from a hive as one notes how these wonderful
organizations made contribution after contribution
to the army and yet remained as vigorous as ever. All
honor to the old Roxbury Artillery and the Fusiliers. The
Roxbury Artillery had a full company in the three-year
regiment, in the 42d on its first tour, and again on its second
service. The Fusiliers did even more. Besides these three
“bits,” they sent the 7th Unattached Company, on May 4,
1864, for ninety days’ duty on Gallop’s Island, Boston, under
command of Capt. Albert E. Proctor, who in civil life was
well known as a popular Boston clothier, and was the other
indistinguishable “twin.” Again on Aug. 18 of that year
they made up Co. K of the 4th Mass. Heavy Artillery for
ten months’ service in Washington, D. C., under the same
Capt. Proctor. Meanwhile they maintained their “depot”
company in a state of efficiency. Certainly they justified
the sentiment of their ancient motto, <i>Aut vincere aut mori</i>,
with all emphasis on the “victory” and never a thought of
“death.”</p>

<p>New companies which were presently to be added to the
1st Regiment also did duty at this time. The “1st Unattached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Company,” which garrisoned Fort Independence,
Boston, for ninety days from April 29, 1864, afterward became
the 4th Company in the regiment. And the “4th Unattached
Company” which garrisoned the fort later to be
known as “Rodman,” in New Bedford harbor for ninety
days from May 3, later became the 5th Company in the
regiment. Likewise the “9th Unattached Company,” which
was to become the 6th Company in the regiment two years
later, on May 10, 1864, began a ninety days’ tour of garrison
duty on Gallop’s Island, Boston Harbor.</p>

<p>How the units of the regiment kept coming back to the
artillery branch thruout the war! The regiment had originally
been artillery; and the virus seemed to be in the regimental
blood. The old cannon were not returned to the
state until 1861. The three-year command served as artillery
for three weeks of 1861 in Washington, and for two
weeks of 1863 in New York. Co. K of the “4th Heavies”
actually reintroduced the “artillery” title into the regiment.
The four unattached companies in 1864 all served as artillery.
Col. Cowdin’s old command was certainly destined
to handle heavier ordnance than the infantry knew anything
about. No wonder they welcomed the restoration of artillery
instruction in 1882.</p>

<p>Well may the 1st-42d Regiment feel interest in Edward
Simmons’ splendid mural painting in the State House, the
“Return of the Colors.” For on the day of that ceremony,
Dec. 22, 1865, color-bearers of both regiments were present;
and both are given place in the picture. The war was over.
These symbols of patriotism for which brave men had sacrificed
life were returning to the custody of the Commonwealth
who gave them. Was ever Forefathers’ day more
sacred than that? The “land of the Pilgrim’s pride” had now
become the “land where” and for which “our fathers died.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE FIGHTING FIRST</h3>


<p>W. F. Fox, in his “Regimental Losses,” published in 1889,
includes a chapter entitled “The three hundred fighting
regiments,” and his list has subsequently become accepted
as a semi-official roll-of-honor. Of the more than two
thousand regiments on the Union side during the Civil War
he found three hundred which lost over one hundred thirty
each, killed or died of wounds. While the number of casualties
might not always indicate fighting ability, or even fighting
experience, still in the long run the blood-marked trail
of killed and wounded does surely lead to where the battle
was most severe.</p>

<p>Amongst the three hundred fighting regiments stands the
1st Mass. Vol. Inf., three-year troops, another name for the
Coast Artillery. Of our various companies who went out
during the three wars in which we have participated, all
losses by killed or died of wounds were confined to those in
the Civil War. No such casualties occurred in 1814 or in
1898. The 3d Reg. lost 2, the one company in the 4th 1, the
one company in the 13th 10, the single company in the 4th
and 29th 5, the company in the 5th 4, the 42d 4, the 43d 3,
or a total of 29. Of the regiments officered by us, the 24th
lost 92, and the 44th 10; but it is not fair to reckon these
as our casualties. In contrast with the total of 29,
the 1st Mass. Vol. Inf. lost 144, besides 643 discharged for
disease or wounds. There can be no question but that
our companies constituting the 1st Mass. Inf., the three-year
regiment, deserve the appellation, “the Fighting First.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the regiment found that their services would
not be accepted for three months, they set to work preparing
for a three-year enlistment. Lt. Col. Burrell and others
who could not go for the long term organized themselves
into a reserve or “depot” regiment. New companies which
had been added in April with a view to entering the three
months’ service brought the total up to ten; and these all
gladly entered into the three-year enlistment. The Chadwick
Light Infantry, named for Hon. Joseph H. Chadwick
of Roxbury, a liberal contributor toward the company expenses,
became 2d Company in the regiment. The Pulaski
Guards, newcomers in the regiment, shifted from 9th to 4th
place. Members of the Chelsea Light Infantry, a 7th Regiment
command which had just been disbanded because of
the disobedience of its captain, resented the false position
in which they were placed; and hastened in a body, on April
19, to the State House where, with Gov. Andrew himself
presiding, they reorganized and forthwith received a charter
as the “Chelsea Volunteers.” This accomplished, the new
unit at once became the 5th Company in the 1st Regiment.
While there had been two 7th Companies within a month,
both had gone off with other regiments; and the vacant
number was now filled by the North End True Blues. The
True Blues consisted of caulkers, gravers and riggers from
the ship-yards. They had begun their history many years
previously as a fire-engine company, and in 1832 had taken
up military training. But it was not until April, 1861, that
they regularly connected themselves with the militia. A
newly organized Brookline company took the 8th place,
made vacant by the transfer of the Boston Artillery. The
National Guards, newcomers in the regiment but with a
history running back to the Mexican war, assumed the 9th
number. And the Schouler Guards, named after the popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Adjutant General of Massachusetts, became the 10th
Company.</p>

<p>Col. Cowdin remained in command, and speedily demonstrated
that he was as capable a leader in actual warfare as
he had been during the years of peace. One notable and
somewhat unusual trait was discovered by his associates&mdash;he
never, under any circumstances, would permit a drop of
alcoholic liquor to pass his lips. George D. Wells, judge
of the Boston municipal court, went as Lieutenant Colonel,
and soon gained the reputation of excelling even his chief
as a tactician. He afterward became colonel of the 34th
Mass. Inf., and was killed at Cedar Creek in 1864. Charles
P. Chandler of the new 8th Company was chosen Major;
and was destined to die in battle a year later, at Glendale
in the White Oak Swamp. The company commanders were:
1st, Ebenezer W. Stone, Jr.; 2d, Abiel G. Chamberlain,
afterwards a colonel of colored troops; 3d, Henry A. Snow,
commander of the company as far back as 1849; 4th, Clark
B. Baldwin, afterwards Lt. Col.; 5th, Sumner Carruth,
later Colonel of the 35th Mass. Inf.; 6th, Edward Pearl;
7th, Gardner Walker, who was to succeed Chandler as
Major; 8th, Edward A. Wild, later a Major of the 32d Mass.
Inf.; 9th, Alfred W. Adams; and 10th, Charles E. Rand.
The 10th was the only company destined to lose its commander
in action, Capt. Rand being killed at Chancellorsville,
and by a singular fatality, his successor, Capt. Moses
H. Warren at Spotsylvania.</p>

<p>In consequence of the regiment’s prompt decision, they
were able to be mustered in as volunteers on May 25, 1861,&mdash;the
first three-year organization in the entire United
States.</p>

<p>The regiment journeyed by rail from Boston and reached
Washington on June 15, the first long-term organization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
to arrive. Passing thru Baltimore they were very cautious,
having in mind the experience of their comrades less than
two months before. But the city was then actually under
complete Federal control.</p>

<p>Blackburn’s Ford, the preliminary skirmish of Bull Run,
on July 18, 1861, first brought the regiment under fire.
Lieut. Albert S. Austin lost his revolver at this time;&mdash;judge
of his pleasant surprise when, in 1896, receiving a package
from a Confederate veteran, he opened it and discovered
the long-missing weapon. This revolver may now be seen
in the collection of the A. &amp; H. Art. Co. Part of an army
all of whose members were inexperienced, it is greatly to
their credit that they were chosen as rear-guard of the retreating
Federals after the main battle of Bull Run, July 21.
Perhaps it was because of the reputation gained here that
the 1st came to be frequently detailed to the responsible rear-guard
position. They served in this capacity during the
change of base on the Peninsula, and during the subsequent
retreat from that district. They covered the retreat of the
army after Fredericksburg. But it is safe to say that they
were never more valuable as rear-guard than when at Bull
Run they steadily held their place behind the torrent of
panic-stricken fugitives and prevented the victors from
pressing the pursuit. This transpired during their first battle,
when they had been less than three months in the
service.</p>

<p>Their gray militia uniforms in which the regiment went
to war cost them dearly at Blackburn’s Ford and Bull Run.
Facing troops similarly attired, Lieut. W. H. B. Smith of
the 3d Company called out that he and his men were from
Massachusetts, thinking that he was talking to other northern
soldiers. But his words were greeted with a volley by
which the lieutenant lost his life. Later in the action a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
similar explanation by Capt. Carruth of the 5th Company
barely prevented a Michigan regiment from firing on the
First. Immediately after the battle new blue uniforms were
issued.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i078.png" width="250" height="412" alt="&quot;White diamond&quot; flag." />
</div>

<p>Three weeks of garrison duty at Fort Albany, Washington,
D. C., ensued, when the regiment was drilled in the
use of heavy artillery. August 13, they were transferred
to Bladensburg on the other side of Washington, where they
first came under the command, as part of the brigade, of Gen.
Hooker. Serving with him in succession as brigade, division,
corps and army commander, they always felt especially
devoted to their chief. It is no accident that Capt. Isaac
P. Gragg of ours wrote in 1900 a book affectionately
tracing the careers and homes of Hooker’s ancestors. The
same veteran and his comrades bore a leading part in securing
the Hooker statue on the State House grounds, dedicated
in 1903. In March, 1862, the regiment received their “white
diamond” badges, of which they were always so proud, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Army of the Potomac then being organized into four corps,
and they forming part of the second division (Hooker’s) of
the third corps.</p>

<p>They were engaged in provost or garrison duty in Maryland
during the winter of ’61-’62, and were stationed during
most of the time at Budd’s Ferry.</p>

<p>From Yorktown to Spotsylvania, during two entire years,
the regiment bore the white flag of Massachusetts and had
an honorable part in all the battles of the Army of the
Potomac, with the exception of South Mountain and Antietam,
which occurred while they were recuperating at
Washington. They were heavily engaged at Williamsburg,
May 5, 1862, where Hooker won the soubriquet, “Fighting
Joe,” of which he was never proud. Here also Col. Cowdin
earned the brigadier-generalship, which was tentatively
awarded him Sept. 26, and of which he was eventually deprived
for political reasons. Col. Cowdin had the misfortune
to be antagonized by the Republican Governor of Massachusetts,
and by the U. S. Senators from the Commonwealth;
the Senate refused to confirm his appointment. The
sword carried by Col. Cowdin at Williamsburg is today in
the Faneuil Hall armory of the Ancient and Honorable
Artillery Company. The regiment lost heavily at Fair
Oakes, June 25, and Glendale, June 30, when Major Charles
P. Chandler was killed. Again suffering severely at second
Bull Run, Aug. 29, and Chantilly, Sept. 1, their effective
numbers were reduced to less than six hundred. It is a
pointed testimony to the high cost of military unpreparedness
that many of the brave men were incapacitated, not by
wounds, but by preventable disease. While Gen. George B.
McClellan’s ability has been a subject of prolonged controversy,
the general never lacked for loyal and devoted
support from the members of the First.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Yorktown is historic ground. Going by water from
Budd’s Ferry, the regiment landed upon the same shore
which Washington’s Continentals had trodden eighty years
earlier. Their progress thru the fields of yellow broom
was over ground rendered memorable by the Revolutionary
heroes. Near the present beautiful National cemetery and
in sight of the present charming Yorktown battle-monument
stood a Confederate intrenchment which occasioned annoyance
to McClellan’s army. It had withstood two assaults,
and was in the way of the army’s advance. Lt. Col. Wells
offered to take the work; and his offer was accepted. Col.
Wells had read American history and knew how “Mad
Anthony” Wayne achieved immortality; the appeal now
would be to cold steel. About 2 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. M.</span> the 5th, 8th and 10th
companies were quietly awakened, the 5th to make the attack,
and the others to serve as supports. The men formed
their line amid the silence of the woods; and, at earliest
dawn, heard their commander whisper, “This is McClellan’s
first order. The honor of Massachusetts is in your keeping.
Charge!” Across four hundred yards of miry, uneven
ground they advanced in the face of Confederate rifle fire.
Arriving at the redoubt, with a shout for old Massachusetts,
they fired a single volley; and completed their task with the
bayonet. Just ten minutes after Col. Wells’ command, the
intrenchment was in Union hands. An old lithograph of
this action is to be seen in the museum of the Cadet Armory,
Boston.</p>

<p>Four members of the 5th Company were here killed.
April 26 was the date of the assault; four days later the
remains were sent north, and in due time were received
with a magnificent demonstration of honor in Chelsea. One
of the dead, Private Allen A. Kingsbury of Medfield,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
was specially honored by the publication of a memorial
biography.</p>

<p>The battle of Williamsburg was almost a private affair
with Hooker’s division. Williamsburg, the “cradle of the
republic” and birthplace of the American revolution, had
once been a proud capital. It is today, and always has been,
noted for the warm-hearted hospitality of its citizens. It
was there that Washington earned his degree as civil engineer,
and there he wooed and won his bride. There
Patrick Henry thundered forth the brave words, “If that be
treason, make the most of it.” And there today the two
sons of President John Tyler reside, one serving as county
judge and the other as president of “William and Mary
College.” But so early as 1862 the glory had departed,
and the shabbiness which accompanies slavery was dominant.
There on May 5, 1862, amid the beeches and sycamore
trees about Fort Magruder Gen. Joseph E. Johnston halted
his retreat and engaged in a rear-guard action. His intrenchments
were shallow; but the pursuing Federal troops
were few&mdash;only a single division. Hence the fighting was
severe. When finally the 1st Regiment marched thru the
town and up “Duke of Gloucester” St. in pursuit of the
broken Confederate column, they felt that they had fully
earned their laurels.</p>

<p>While most of the Union army went up the York river by
boat, the 1st Regiment made the journey on land. Altho
the country was naturally fertile and the climate of the best,
a general seediness and “run down” condition prevailed,
so that it was like a desert to the weary, hungry marchers.
Finally the Williamsburg road brought the troops to Seven
Pines&mdash;the spot from whose tree-tops could be seen the
spires of Richmond, six miles away. Doubtless everyone
has passed thru some experience so terrible that it comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
back in his moments of nightmare. Seven Pines and Savage’s
Station fill that rôle for veterans of the old 1st. Today
a portion of the battle-field is a National cemetery, a
veritable God’s acre, sacred to the memory of the dead,
melodious with the voice of cat-bird and mocking-bird and
the graceful killdeer. There the magnolia grows to perfection
and the luscious fig matures in the summer sunshine.
But this district, usually so dry and substantial, is at the
edge of the Chickahominy or White Oak Swamp. From
May 31 to June 25, 1862, unusually severe rains swelled the
Chickahominy and inundated the surrounding country. Fortunately
there are islands in the swamp, places of partial
refuge, to which our men resorted. McClellan’s plan called
for a junction with the army of Irvin McDowell about June
1, and for a grand assault by the combined forces upon the
Confederate Johnston. For reasons which seemed adequate
to the authorities in Washington, notwithstanding the serious
results for McClellan and his army, McDowell was forbidden
to march south and keep his appointment. While
McClellan waited, and while the floods refused to abate,
the Army of the Potomac was in a bad way. R. E. Lee,
Johnston’s successor, attacked nearly every day. Mosquitoes
bit, and the result thereof was malaria. Finally the ground
was dug over and fought over so constantly that there was
time neither to care for the wounded nor bury the dead;
and a condition of horror ensued which surpasses all power
of description. Men actually had to sleep side by side with
their dead comrades,&mdash;comrades who had been dead for
days. It is very easy to understand why the Peninsular campaign
developed into a retreat; a month of such fighting
was all that flesh and blood could endure. Not even the
issue of a whiskey ration, which commenced at this time,
could sufficiently blunt the soldiers’ senses&mdash;altho it did accomplish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
vast moral damage. So when McClellan became
convinced that he would not have McDowell’s co-operation,
he turned back; he could do nothing else.</p>

<p>It was easier in the north to organize new regiments with
their numerous openings for the appointment of officers, and
with the enlisted men starting military life on an equality
rather than with some as veterans and others as “rookies.”
Nevertheless this system resulted in depleting the older and
more experienced regiments, and cost the government millions
of dollars in unnecessary expense. Massachusetts, by
contrast with other states, did recruit up her three-year
regiments, and endeavored to keep their ranks filled, even
tho the later accessions had to be given the privilege of taking
discharges with their regiments at the end of less than
three years. Sept. 5, 1862, a large number of recruits arrived,
who had been enlisted by officers of the 1st in Massachusetts,
and who brought the companies once more up
to one hundred each. About the same time there was an
exchange of prisoners, and the men who returned from their
unwilling residence in southern cities had many interesting
experiences to relate.</p>

<p>After the Peninsular campaign, as regiments became reduced
in size to not more than five hundred men, the government
decided to economize by dismissing the regimental
bands, and substituting brigade bands. The First bade
regretful farewell to their musicians; this method of saving
money the men regarded as a mistake.</p>

<p>Much of the hard fighting done by the 1st Regiment took
place within a very limited area. Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville,
the Wilderness and Spotsylvania all lie within
a few square miles, and all can be visited by automobile
within half a day. Moreover a visitor cannot fail to be
impressed with the fact that these battle-fields seem to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
been selected so as to destroy the least possible amount of
private property. Outside of the actual city of Fredericksburg,
the country is little better than pine-barren, and contains
few houses and not even much cultivated land. Since
we now know pines to be health-giving, and well-drained
sandy soil to be freest from disease germs, we can see how
this choice of battle-fields by the Army of the Potomac
doubtless saved lives as well as property. The climate too
is free from extremes. But the men of 1863 and 1864 did
not appreciate these things; all that they had time to notice
were the dust and drought and heat and hunger and hard
fighting.</p>

<p>At Fredericksburg Gen. A. E. Burnside tried to march
directly south toward Richmond, crossing the Rappahannock
on pontoon bridges. It was a winter battle&mdash;the date was
Dec. 13, 1862&mdash;with great discomfort and a fair chance that
wounded men would freeze to death. Fifer Bardeen tells
that one captain, Walker, trembled as he entered the battle&mdash;and
Capt. Walker was the bravest of the brave. Lee had
every advantage of position; the resulting disaster was inevitable.</p>

<p>About two months after Col. Cowdin’s promotion, as the
regiment were covering the retreat of the army from Fredericksburg,
they were introduced to their new colonel.
Napoleon B. McLoughlin, in spite of his French-Irish name,
was a Vermont Yankee. He had entered the regular army
from the New York 7th, and at the time of his appointment
to the Colonelcy was a captain in the 6th U. S. Cavalry.
He was respected and well liked; but he always suffered
from the fact that the men felt him somewhat of an interloper.
Capt. Baldwin of the 4th Company had become
Lt. Col. and by all rules of seniority should have been made
Colonel. However Col. McLoughlin held the esteem of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
men, and made an honorable record. His regular army
strictness was beneficial to his new command. On Feb. 9,
1863, two months after the arrival of the new colonel, the
regiment was subjected to an extremely rigid inspection;
and was pronounced one of the eleven best disciplined and
most efficient regiments of the one hundred fifty constituting
the Army of the Potomac.</p>

<p>Chancellorsville, May 2 and 3, 1863, was the next great
battle. Gen. J. Hooker crossed the Rappahannock several
miles above Fredericksburg and tried to turn Lee’s left flank.
Hooker unexpectedly came into collision with Stonewall
Jackson’s troops and instead of hurting Lee, almost suffered
the humiliation of seeing his own right flank crumpled
up. At the most critical moment of the Chancellorsville
fight, Hooker was wounded and the army left without
a head. When O. O. Howard’s 11th corps broke and ran
(“started for Germany”), it was only the 1st Regiment and
other troops under Dan. Sickles who saved the Union army
from destruction. Their promptness in entering the breach
in the lines, and their stubborn courage in remaining there
hour after hour, were all that checked the on-rushing Confederates.
At Chancellorsville the regiment was for the
first time serving under both of its best-loved commanders,
Gens. Hooker and Sickles.</p>

<p>On the night following Howard’s break, according to
common belief amongst the men, it fell to their fate to be
the slayers of Gen. “Stonewall” Jackson, one of the severest
blows to the Confederate cause during the entire war. The
6th and 10th Companies were on outpost when a party of
Confederate horsemen rode down the Plank Road toward
their lines. As a result of the volley then fired, Gen Jackson
fell, the identification being made complete by Sergt.
Charles F. Ferguson of the 10th Company, who was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
prisoner-of-war for a few minutes, and happened to be
close to the mounted officers when the fire was received.
Ferguson made his escape in the ensuing confusion. This
event was merely an accident of warfare, and entirely unpremeditated.
While others claim to have been the agents
of Jackson’s removal, and altho the Southerners say that
their own men fired the fatal shots, still there is no good
reason for rejecting the contention of the 1st Regiment,&mdash;in
fact the evidence seems conclusive that our claim is valid.</p>

<p>The plain shaft which marks the spot where Jackson fell
is a painful reminder to men of the 1st. Returning a year
later, at the opening of the battle of the Wilderness, May
5 and 6, 1864, they were stationed upon the very ground
over which they had fought in ’63. And when, during a lull
in the fighting, they inspected their surroundings, they found
human bones and fragments of clothing sufficient to identify
some of their own regimental dead. The bodies of those
slain at Chancellorsville had never been buried. No wonder
that men shuddered as they saw the “buzzards” soaring
over head.</p>

<p>Deep was the discouragement preceding Gettysburg. The
failure at Chancellorsville had been due to no fault of the
men and left them questioning whether they could ever meet
Lee on favorable terms. They were not fond of Meade.
Their march thru Maryland and into Pennsylvania was the
most trying of the entire war. On June 25, 1863, after following
the muddy tow-path of the C. &amp; O. Canal all day,
only two footmen were able to keep with the mounted officers
until night-fall. Stragglers kept coming in during
the entire night. Then, at Gettysburg, on the July days
of 1863, July 1, 2, and 3, the tide finally turned, and the
rebellion began to ebb away.</p>

<p>Historians differ concerning the relative importance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the second and third days at Gettysburg. Gen. Sheridan in
1880, and Gen. Longstreet in 1902, and Capt. J. Long in his
“Sixteenth Decisive Battle of the World,” published in 1906,
took the ground that the battle was won on the second day,
by Sickles and the third corps. Gen. Sickles had been posted
on low ground to the north of “Little Round Top.” Becoming
convinced that Longstreet was about to attack and
crumple up the Union left flank, just as Jackson had crushed
the Union right at Chancellorsville, he determined to prevent
such a disaster by moving his corps forward to the
higher ground, running north from the Peach Orchard along
the Emmetsburg road. The 1st Mass. Inf., at the “Peter
Rogers house,” held the most advanced position of the entire
army. As a consequence Longstreet had no more than
started when he unexpectedly came upon Sickles’ men,
where he found plenty to keep him busy and was unable to
crush anyone. At the day’s close the Union regiments were
compelled to fall back to Round Top. But meanwhile, by
Longstreet’s own admission, the Confederate plans had
failed entirely and Lee had been defeated. The gallant
charge of the Virginians on the third day was only a desperate
final attempt by a beaten army, before commencing its
retreat. Near the Peter Rogers house, in 1886, was erected
the regimental monument of the First, a granite “white
diamond,” bearing the words, “On July 2, 1863, from 11
<span class="smcap lowercase">A. M.</span> to 6.30 <span class="smcap lowercase">P. M.</span>, the First Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry,
Lieut.-Col. Clark B. Baldwin commanding, occupied
this spot in support of its skirmish line 800 ft. in advance.
The Regiment subsequently took position in the brigade line
and was engaged until the close of the action. Casualties:
Killed, 18; Died of wounds, 9; Wounded, 80; Prisoners, 15;
Total, 122.” But for Sickles’ advanced stand with the third
corps on July 2, there would not have been a third day at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Gettysburg. A model of the regimental monument may be
seen at the museum of the Loyal Legion in the Cadet
Armory, Boston.</p>

<p>Corporal Nathaniel M. Allen of the 6th Company was
later awarded the Congressional medal of honor for here
bringing off the regimental colors at the greatest personal
risk, after the color sergeant had fallen. Col. Baldwin and
Adjutant Mudge were wounded. It was on this same
day that Lieut. James Doherty of the 10th Company
steadied his men in the face of a hot rifle fire, by calmly
exercising them in the manual of arms. Doherty was
a character. A most gallant officer, he had risen from the
ranks and never lost his fellow feeling for the enlisted men.
An ex-sailor, he had the sailor’s vices. Once, in 1863, while
passing thru Baltimore, he became drunk, and tried to kill
an officer of another regiment. Had not Col. Baldwin seized
a musket and clubbed Doherty over the head, murder would
have been done. In New York he was placed under charges
for telling his commanding general that he “lied.” But the
charges were never pressed; perhaps the accusation was
true. At Chancellorsville he was wounded in the finger by a
bullet which managed to wind itself about the bone. Doherty
roundly cursed the enemy for using defective lead. The
brave lieutenant finally died in battle. A well-loved member
of the regiment, Corp. Albert A. Farnham of the 4th Company,
was taken prisoner at Gettysburg, and died in Richmond
the 15th of the following November, his death being
due to dysentery caused by insufficient and unsuitable food.
His soldier’s hymn-book is in the museum of the A. &amp; H.
Art. Co.</p>

<p>July 30 to Oct. 7, the regiment was one of four on provost
duty in New York City, guarding against further draft-riots,
and preventing conscripts from deserting. Here they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
resumed heavy artillery drill; and incidentally became rested
after the Gettysburg campaign.</p>

<p>A new commander directed the army in the Wilderness,
Lieutenant General U. S. Grant. The difference of men
showed itself in the different result. Altho the 1st, now
under Gen. W. S. Hancock, and the other Union regiments
were handled as roughly in 1864 as they had been in 1863,
when they left the field of battle, it was to march southward
past Lee’s flank rather than northward toward security.
Scrub oak and pine have obliterated practically all traces
of the great fight. But men can never forget that the Wilderness
proved that the tide had turned, and marked a long
step toward the downfall of the Confederacy.</p>

<p>Spotsylvania was a continuation of the Wilderness with
the fighting increased, if possible, in ferocity. On May 12,
the culminating day at the “bloody angle,” the 1st Regiment
was heavily engaged for the last time in its career. During
the morning it acted as provost guard immediately behind
the firing line, with orders to permit no one to pass to the
rear excepting wounded men. In the afternoon it was advanced
into the very thickest of the conflict and assigned
the task of covering part of the Confederate line with a
curtain of fire. Here both armies intrenched, and charged
each other’s earthworks. The fighting was amid tangled
underbrush wherein one could see only a few feet ahead;
at such short range the bullet gave way to the bayonet and
even to the clubbed rifle. When the combat continued after
darkness had fallen, the fighting increased in intensity.
Someone had to yield&mdash;Lee retreated. The apples which
today grow at the bloody angle should be redder and the
corn should bear more red ears, for they grow on sacred
soil once crimson with the life-blood of heroes.</p>

<p>As they approached the completion of their enlistment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the 1st Regiment were stationed with the reserves. Here,
on May 19, they took part in their last engagement, at Anderson’s
Plantation, on the road to Fredericksburg&mdash;and
home. R. S. Ewell’s corps of Confederates came around
Grant’s right flank and attempted to cut communications
with the north and to capture the wagon-trains. A brigade
of heavy artillery regiments fresh from the defenses of
Washington were acting as convoy&mdash;one of them being the
1st Mass. Heavy Artillery from Salem. Here the Salem
men have erected their regimental monument. The heavy
artillery had seen but little fighting; but they now stood up
like veterans and drove back an entire corps. Unfortunately
the Confederates were taking some of the wagons with them
as they drew back; and it remained for the 1st Inf. and their
companions in the brigade, some 1,200 in all, to rush to the
rescue and recover the lost train. While both 1st Mass.
regiments&mdash;the Art. and the Inf.&mdash;were equally brave, the
1st Inf. had learned by long experience to make use of
“cover,” to shelter themselves behind trees, stones and
earthworks. It was largely this skill that enabled them to
stop the panic and save the Union army at Chancellorsville.
Now, on this less important field, it saved Grant’s wagons
from capture.</p>

<p>Then came the welcome order to return to Boston and
be mustered out.</p>

<p>A great reception awaited the regiment in Boston. Gen.
Cowdin was grand marshal of the parade, and all Boston
came to extend the hand of welcome. Gen. Cowdin had
been honored that year by election as Captain of the Ancient
and Honorable Artillery Company, and of course was loyally
supported by this command in all the exercises connected
with the reception. Another ex-Colonel of the regiment,
Gen. Walter E. Lombard in 1916, was similarly to be honored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
by America’s oldest military organization. A grim
pathos obtruded itself upon the spirit of the festivities; for
of the 1,651 men who had gone to war, only 494 were present
on May 25, 1864, to be mustered out. The command
had been in twenty general actions; and nine of its seventy-one
officers had been killed. It marched 1,263 miles, travelled
by rail 1,325 miles, and on transports 724. The regiment
gave three general officers to the army, and ninety-one
other officers to sister regiments.</p>

<p>A number of noted clergymen have at times held the
office of chaplain of the command. Applying the standards
which control the selection of names for the volume, “Who’s
Who,” amongst the distinguished chaplains would certainly
have to be mentioned Otis A. Skinner, the noted journalist
and preacher, 1850-’55; Thomas B. Thayer, the writer, 1858-’61;
Jacob M. Manning, the lecturer, 1862-’63; Lewis B.
Bates, father of ex-Gov. Bates, 1868-’72; Alonzo H. Quint,
the ecclesiastical statesman, 1872-’76; William H. H.
(“Adirondack”) Murray, devotee of horses and woodcraft,
1873-’76; Minot J. Savage, author and poet, 1883-’96; and
Edward A. Horton, the orator, Chaplain of the Mass. State
Senate, 1896-1900. Preeminent among them stands the
name of the war chaplain, Warren H. Cudworth, 1861-’72,
’76-’82. Chaplain Cudworth possesses the added distinction
that he was the historian of the “Fighting First.”</p>

<p>Warren H. Cudworth had graduated from Harvard in
1850; and represented the finest type of American culture.
If size of hat indicates mental caliber, his chapeau, sacredly
preserved at the Soldiers’ Home, Chelsea, proves him to
have been an intellectual giant. For it is number seven and
one-half. Since 1852 he had been pastor of the Unitarian
“Church of Our Father” in East Boston. A bachelor, and
of independent means financially, he was able to prove his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
patriotism before receiving appointment as chaplain by announcing
to his church that, if he should not secure the
appointment, he would give his salary as minister to maintain
work among the soldiers. The church had raised a
fund for the erection of a new house of worship; this the
pastor urged them not to spend as intended, but to devote
the money to the welfare of the Union soldiers. When
appointed, he gave himself unreservedly to the duties of the
office; and absented himself from his regiment only once,
for a single week of Aug., ’61, during the entire three years.</p>

<p>While not a “fighting chaplain” as some were, he was in
every sense a brave soldier and true gentleman. Believing
that the better American one is, the better American soldier
he is, Cudworth both preached and exemplified this part of
his creed.</p>

<p>His Massachusetts pride revealed itself in his comments
upon the inferior standards of living and comfort as one
progressed southward.</p>

<p>His scholarly interest in history and science kept showing
thruout all his writings. Bladensburg is noted as the field
of the disastrous militia defeat in 1814; there is no glossing
over the uncomfortable facts. Bladensburg is also the
duelling-ground where Commodore Barron killed Decatur
in 1820. A scientific observer, he comments upon the excellence
of the spring water. At Yorktown the regiment
was encamped on historic ground, where Washington’s tents
had stood, and Cornwallis surrendered, in 1781. But he
somehow fails to note there the oldest custom-house in
America. One is reminded of high-school days to hear him
commenting upon McClellan’s bridges over the Chickahominy&mdash;that
they were exact reproductions of Cæsar’s
famous span across the Rhine. Cudworth comments appreciatively
upon the notable past of the Fairfax family, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
influential in moulding the career of George Washington;
of the Chancellors; and even records facts about Prince
Frederick, father of George III, after whom Fredericksburg
was named. Fossils and other geological remains
unearthed by regimental well-diggers on the Peninsula interest
him.</p>

<p>But his chief interest was in men and their welfare. The
degradation which he saw occasioned by slavery brought
sorrow to his heart. The untidy appearance of Williamsburg
and other Virginia towns&mdash;a consequence of slavery&mdash;impressed
him, as it does the visitor today. None rejoiced
more than he over the issuance of the emancipation proclamation
on Jan. 1, 1863, and he felt that such a clear pronouncement
for justice and righteousness was more potent
than many victories. At Williamsburg he commented on
the generous hospitality of the southerners; he was also
amused by quaint epitaphs in the old Bruton parish cemetery.
At the close of the Peninsular campaign he manifested his
social interest by commenting that the army was then existing
in accordance with ideal industrial conditions&mdash;eight
hours daily for work, eight for rest, and eight for recreation.
When a whiskey ration was instituted in 1862, he deplored
the resultant moral evils.</p>

<p>Such a chaplain would do everything possible for the welfare
of the men. During the first leisure season in the regiment’s
existence, that in 1861 at Budd’s Ferry, he organized
a chess club which conducted exciting tournaments; a literary
institute or debating society named after Mayor Frank
B. Fay of Chelsea; and a large temperance society bearing
the name of their total-abstinence Colonel, Cowdin, which
enrolled nearly two hundred soldiers on its pledge, and had
fully one-third of the regiment “on the water wagon.” The
chaplain’s tent was indeed the social center of the camp.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Most important of all was his religious organization. The
Y. M. C. A. had not then been introduced; so the chaplain
devised an association, which he termed “The Church of the
First Regiment.” Their admirable covenant, by which they
existed, “You now solemnly covenant, in the presence of
God and these your fellow-soldiers, that you will endeavor,
by the help of grace, to walk in all the ordinances of the
gospel blameless, adorning your Christian profession by a
holy life and a godly conversation,” has received much unsolicited
praise; and has afforded an inspiring model for
other military chaplains.</p>

<p>Chaplain Cudworth was idolized by the men. They affectionately
called him “Holy Jo”; and he accepted the title
as a mark of affection, stipulating however that they must
never pervert it into “unholy Jo.” Fifer Bardeen of the
1st Company tells how, in a New York barber-shop, he
thrilled the crowd by a narrative of his own supposed heroism
in battle, all suggested by a boyhood scar on his head.
After he had told enough “whoppers” to set himself up as
a hero, he glanced into the mirror and was thunderstruck to
see “Holy Jo” occupying the next chair but one. The chaplain
knew Bardeen well, and also knew just how true the
yarn was not. But under the circumstances he showed his
real self by utterly failing to recognize or embarrass the
youthful hero. No wonder that Bardeen later wrote concerning
the chaplain, “He was a good man, a patriot and a
Christian, ready to pray with you at the proper time but
never obtruding his piety, and always ready to help you in
any way. There was no other officer in the regiment who
approached him for genuine manhood of the highest type.”</p>

<p>Chaplain Cudworth’s passing was in keeping with the
rest of his life. His death was that of a Christian soldier.
It happened on Thanksgiving day, 1883, while the Chaplain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
was participating in a union observance of the day held in
a neighbor church, the “Maverick Congregational” of East
Boston. As he was standing beside the pulpit in the very
act of offering public prayer, suddenly he was heard to exclaim
in pain, “I cannot go on.” Before others could reach
him, he fell to the floor, dead.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>1866-1878</h3>


<p>It was inevitable that a reaction should follow the prolonged
military exertion of the Civil War. The north had
strained its resources almost to the breaking point, and
people were tired of the very thought of a soldier. Volunteer
regiments, upon their muster-out, disbanded outright;
while militia organizations languished, and ofttimes died.
“General apathy” was again in command of the situation.</p>

<p>Disbandment was the ultimate fate of the three-year regiment
which had gone out under Col. Cowdin. Fortunately
many veterans of the companies retained interest in military
affairs, and appreciated the importance of maintaining the
militia, so that they connected themselves with organizations
designed to perpetuate the old regiment. Finally, on
May 18, 1866, orders issued for the reorganization of the
command.</p>

<p>As Col. Burrell’s 42d Regiment had retained a place in
the militia establishment thru the sheer pertinacity of its
officers, and as it was recognized to be a continuation of
the old militia 1st Regiment, Col. Burrell was continued in
command of the new 1st. The 1st Company was the corresponding
company of the 42d. An unattached company,
the 81st, consisting largely of 1st Regiment veterans and
commanded by Lieutenant George H. Johnston, Adjutant
of the 1st, took 2d place in the reorganized regiment. The
Fusiliers’ reserve or “depot” company (the 25th Unattached)
continued as 3d Company, under command of Capt.
Alfred N. Proctor, who had led the 3d Company of the 42d.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Chelsea continued to supply the 5th Company, having organized
the “Rifles” (4th Unattached), soon renamed “Veterans,”
as a “depot” company for the original 5th Company
(the “Volunteers”); Capt. John Q. Adams commanded.
Veterans of the original 6th Company (now the 9th Unattached)
under their war commander, Capt. George H.
Smith, continued to represent the old number. The 10th
Company of the 42d, under command of their war 1st Lieutenant,
Edward Merrill, Jr., remained as 10th Company of
the reorganized regiment. Thus six companies of Col. Burrell’s
new command were perpetuations of the old regiment
of which he and Col. Cowdin had been field officers. The
new 4th Company had seen ninety days’ service under its
designation of 1st Unattached, and was commanded by Capt.
Moses E. Bigelow. Three companies, the 7th, 8th and 9th,
had no war records, and merely came in as the 45th, 66th
(the W. Roxbury Rifles) and 67th Unattached. The latter
two, however, were commanded by veteran officers, G. M.
Fillebrown, formerly a 1st Lieut. in the Mass. Cavalry, and
John D. Ryan, a 2d Lieut. in the 61st Mass. Inf., respectively.
Capt. Fillebrown’s company is the 8th Co. today. With six
of the ten companies coming directly from the old regiment,
it is no wonder that the new organization was granted the
right to call itself the 1st Mass. Infantry.</p>

<p>Col. Burrell remained at the head of the regiment only
sufficiently long to see it established on a firm foundation;
on July 26, 1866, he was promoted to be Brigadier General.
On August 29, 1866, Capt. George H. Johnston of the 2d
Company became Colonel. The original record book of this
period is in the custody of Maj. J. W. H. Myrick of the
Fusilier Veterans.</p>

<p>Col. Johnston’s first camp was held at Sharon in 1866,
and had an attendance of 533. With so large a proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of the membership war veterans, the event seemed very
much like a military reunion. Officers and men were already
thoroly trained; all enjoyed the experience of again wearing
the blue uniform. Similar encampments were held in
1867, 1868, 1869 and 1872&mdash;all in Hull. In 1870 the entire
state militia, under command of Gen. Benjamin F. Butler,
encamped at Concord, and revived the memories of 1859.
But how greatly had the situation changed during those
eleven short intervening years! Then the war was a dread
prospect; now it was a glorious retrospect. In 1871 a regimental
encampment was held at Quincy.</p>

<p>On June 22, 1867, Col. Johnston and his regiment paraded
as escort to President Andrew Johnson. A similar compliment
was paid to President U. S. Grant, June 16, 1869. The
regiment also paraded in honor of Gen. Philip H. Sheridan,
when he visited Boston.</p>

<p>A new company, the Claflin Guards of Newton, was organized
in 1870, and in 1872 became the 7th Company.</p>

<p>As a result of the Civil War the kepi and felt hat had
been introduced into the bill-of-dress, and the five-button
blouse had become the popular coat; the felt hat was a
revival of a pattern common in old Colonial days. In 1869
the regiment profited by a new feeling on the part of the
legislature that a good militia was worth the expenditure
of a little money; for at that time the state began to make
an allowance toward the purchase of uniforms. $20.00
was paid for each man&mdash;not enough to buy a uniform, but
far better than nothing. Since their experience at Bull Run
in 1861, the regiment had worn blue; now, however, they
returned to the gray uniforms of 1859. Breech-loading
rifles were issued in 1872.</p>

<p>The year 1872 brought the most prolonged tour of duty
for the maintenance of public order, if we except Shays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>’
rebellion, that the regiment ever had. Boston was then a
city of frame buildings, standing close together, and separated
by very narrow streets. On Nov. 11, fire broke out,
and speedily grew uncontrollable by reason of high winds.
When after three days of horror, the devouring flames were
finally stayed in their work of destruction, old Boston lay
in ashes.</p>

<p>Thieves, thugs and criminals of every sort are prompt
to congregate in seasons of public calamity. When society
is threatened by such a danger as conflagration, its ordinary
police precautions break down; and people are helpless to
protect their property or even their lives. All the militia in
Boston were immediately called out to help rescue endangered
lives, and to protect the panic-stricken fugitives.
Where everyone is suspicious of everyone else, a man in
uniform is the only one able to render any aid. Victims of
the fire would not allow a stranger in civilian clothes so
much as to assist them to places of safety, for fear of violence
and robbery. The troops were kept on duty during
thirteen days, the latter part of the period being devoted to
guarding the ruins and aiding in the task of rehabilitation.
One picturesque feature of the regiment’s service was the
escorting across the city of treasure valued at $14,000,000.
No other call to duty is so truly a test of military readiness
as that in connection with a fire, coming as it does always
without the slightest previous warning. And no other duty,
performed as the 1st Regiment performed it in 1872, does so
much to win friends for the organization, and for the National
Guard of which it forms a part. At no other time
does the National Guardsman appear so nearly in his true
rôle, as “a soldier of peace.”</p>

<p>During the term of the next commander, Col. Henry W.
Wilson, Dec. 12, 1872&mdash;April 28, 1876, the regiment felt the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
effects of a new movement for military efficiency. Col. Wilson
was himself a Civil War veteran, an ex-Captain in the
6th Regiment. But he believed the time ripe for innovations
and improvements. The Civil War officers were growing
too old for active service; and no one was in training to
take their place. England, with a military system not essentially
different from ours, had introduced strict principles
of instruction for her volunteers some ten years previously,
and now commenced to reap beneficial results.</p>

<p>Consequently the 1st Regiment welcomed the new state
muster-field, first opened for use in 1873. Framingham at
once became a synonym for increased efficiency; that very
year the tour of camp duty was lengthened from three to
four days, and from time to time thereafter successful effort
was made to secure further extension. Massachusetts had
the proud honor of leading all other states in providing a
regular state camp-ground.</p>

<p>Perhaps because so many “old fellows” were bidding farewell
to active military life, perhaps for other reasons, this
was an age of sentimentalism in the regimental history. On
Dec. 17, 1873, the 1st Company adopted a badge or medal
for use with full-dress uniforms and also on civilian clothes;
and other companies were so favorably impressed by the
innovation as to imitate it. Col. Mathews later designed
the regimental emblem which stands on the cover of this
book, and which is based on the “white diamond” of the
old “third corps.”</p>

<p>Capt. William A. Smith of the 1st Company was an enthusiast
about rifle-shooting; and kept agitating the matter
with a view to inducing Massachusetts to take it up. Already
England had her ranges for volunteers, and in New
York the Creedmoor range was in active operation. Capt.
Smith presented many excellent reasons why small arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
practice should be made part of the militia requirements.
In Colonial days every farmer was a good shot&mdash;he had to
be, in order to keep down “varmints” and to keep off Indians.
But when the state became fully settled the reason
for popular skill in shooting ceased, and the shooting itself
was discontinued. Thruout the Civil War, marksmanship
was a neglected factor in the training of both northern and
southern armies. By 1875 the need had become so crying
that Capt. Smith and others succeeded in convincing the
Massachusetts authorities. As soon as genuine rifle competitions
were authorized, the members of the regiment, and
especially of the 1st Company, stirred themselves to render
the matches exciting; as a consequence, up to the time the
regiment became interested in artillery, it was noted in the
state for success in small arms competitions. From the 1st
Company alone went out two such shots as Col. Horace T.
Rockwell and Major Charles W. Hinman, both of whom
had places on rifle teams which went to England and represented
America in international matches held in 1880, 1883
and 1888. After 1878 the 4th and 12th Companies also won
fame with the rifle.</p>

<p>The annual routine of a militia regiment&mdash;weekly drills,
two or more field-days, shooting, one or two weeks’ camp,
etc.&mdash;keeps the members busy along useful lines. But it
does not afford a historian much to tell, save as he indicates
the steps of progress from year to year. Parades, on the
other hand, possess some romantic and popular interest;
and it is hard to convince laymen that they have almost no
military value. A regiment is largely judged by its appearance
on parade. In Col. Wilson’s time there chanced to be
included the fateful year, 1875, when eastern Massachusetts
celebrated the centennials of Concord and Bunker Hill.
With President Grant present from Washington on April<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
19, there were “great doings.” On June 17 the “crack”-est
military organizations from other states visited Boston to
lend “tone” to the procession,&mdash;the 7th N. Y., the 5th Md.,
the 1st R. I., the 1st and 2d Pa. That day Gen. W. T.
Sherman was reviewing officer. Sherman’s war experience
had trained him to judge troops. He was forced to admit
that Boston’s parade was a fine military display; and he had
to add that the 1st Mass. was not behind the best. On Nov.
29, 1875, by a singular coincidence, Col. Wilson was called
upon to parade his regiment as part of the funeral escort
for his great namesake, the late Vice-President Henry Wilson,
who was interred at Natick.</p>

<p>At first the regiment suffered from the new innovations.
Its older members, trained in the hard school of actual war
service were capable soldiers and required little instruction;
and the younger men who needed more training were only
a minority in point of numbers. As soon as it became evident
that more time was going to be demanded for encampments
and for small-arms practice, many older soldiers
applied for their discharges. As the ranks grew shorter and
thinner, the state authorities began to talk of disbanding
companies, just as they had always been accustomed to do.
Finally the break came. Col. Wilson resigned on April 28,
1876, leaving Lt. Col. Alfred N. Proctor in command; and
on the following July 6, the regiment was reduced to the
dimensions of a battalion and was redesignated the “1st Battalion
of Infantry.” Lt. Col. Nathaniel Wales, who was
placed in command, was a Civil War veteran with a brilliant
record. He had enlisted as a private soldier, had served in
the 24th Regiment, the 32d, and finally in the 35th, and came
out of the war-service a Colonel. It is highly unusual to
pass thru so many grades within less than four short years.
Furthermore, Col. Wales was said to have been the youngest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
man holding the rank of Colonel at the time he attained it.
His love for the 1st Regiment was such that he was willing
to endure a reduction of rank for the sake of re-establishing
the old command upon a secure basis.</p>

<p>A company of the 3d Regiment, the Cunningham Rifles
from Brockton, were transferred to the 1st Battalion at the
time of the reorganization and became the 10th Company.
This reorganization was by no means limited to the 1st
Regiment&mdash;it was state-wide in its incidence. The 1st Battalion
emerged from it as a six-company organization.</p>

<p>One or more companies of the 1st made the trip to the
Philadelphia Centennial in 1876, and to the Valley Forge
Centenary the year following. On Sept. 17, 1877, the battalion
participated in the parade and ceremonies connected
with the dedication of the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ monument
on Boston Common. The companies presented a fine appearance
in the eyes of the public; and following the celebration
dined together much to their own gratification. New
members enlisted, new interest began to be manifest, and
there was a feeling that the present reduced condition would
be only temporary. Col. Wales of course exerted all of his
influence to have the regiment restored.</p>

<p>Finally the legislature responded and passed an act creating
a 1st Regiment by a process of consolidation. There
were four companies left of the 3d Regiment, then forming
the 3d Battalion. And four companies represented what
had originally been the old 1st Infantry of ante-bellum days,
now organized as the 4th Battalion. So the legislature transferred
the Fusiliers and the Claflin Guards to the 5th, the
Chelsea Rifles to the 8th, and consolidated the 1st Battalion,
the 3d Battalion and the 4th Battalion, as the “1st Regiment,”
Col. Nathaniel Wales commanding. The date of this
important legislation was Dec. 3, 1878. By a stroke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
genius the law-makers had created a twelve-company regiment,
organized in three battalions each under command of
a Major; and had devised a new plan of organization which
was destined to work so well that, twenty years later, Congress
would adopt it for use all over the United States. As
the companies from the 3d Regiment were located in Plymouth
and Bristol counties, they introduced a new geographical
element into the 1st. Thereafter “The Cape” was to
stand side by side with Boston, and right nobly were the
Cape companies to uphold the regimental traditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE OLD “TIGER” FIRST</h3>


<p>It now becomes necessary to go back and trace out the
origins of the organizations which were consolidated with
the 1st Regiment in 1878. Let us first give attention to the
companies which bore the title of 4th Battalion. We shall
discover a battalion or regimental history stretching back
to 1834, and company records commencing as early as 1787.</p>

<p>Three “independent companies” of infantry were listed
in the roster of 1788 as connected with the 1st Division,
Suffolk. One of these disappeared from the records the
following year, and another in 1792. The lone survivor yet
survives&mdash;in fact is the 3d Company, M. C. A., otherwise
known as the Independent Boston Fusiliers.</p>

<p>On May 11, 1787, the Governor’s Council voted to approve
an application signed by Thomas Adams and fifty-three
others, and to charter a company. Gov. James Bowdoin
presided at the Council meeting and himself introduced the
petition. On the following July 4, he stood with the members
of the new company on the slope of Bunker Hill and,
at that shrine of American liberty, presented them their
official charter. They next proceeded to the home of John
Hancock, soon to be Governor, and at his liberal table, as his
guests, enjoyed an inaugural dinner. The Fusiliers have
excelled in many military lines thruout their long and honorable
history&mdash;by no means least of their attainments is the
masterly skill with which they have maintained the custom
of dining together. Their motto, <i>Aut vincere aut mori</i>,
seemed high-sounding in the early years. “Conquer or die<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>”
presented harsh alternatives. But the time was to come
seventy-five years later when the nation needed just such
stern, self-sacrificing devotion; and then the Fusiliers indeed
lived up to their motto. The Fusiliers wore red coats,
in commemoration of certain gallant foemen with whom
America had recently been engaged. As the Cadets were
then clad in white and another company in blue, a striking
patriotic ensemble was produced by the grouping of uniforms
whenever the independent companies paraded. William
Turner was elected the first Fusilier Captain; the names
of his successors are recorded elsewhere in this book. No
wonder that the Fusiliers, actives or veterans, have always
been noted for maintaining the most successful and distinguished
military ball in all Boston, the military-social event
of the year; for their first Captain was, by profession,
a dancing-master. Capt. Turner was succeeded by Capt.
Joseph Laughton, who when not on militia duty, was occupied
as a clerk in the Treasurer’s office.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i109.jpg" width="600" height="427" alt="" />
<span class="smcap">The Fusiliers about 1845</span>
</div>

<p>After 1798 the Fusiliers were never without vigorous and
congenial companionship. Enthusiasm was then in full
flood; George Washington had shown his patriotism by consenting
to accept a subordinate position, that of Lieutenant
General of the army under President John Adams; and men
were enrolling themselves in the new legionary brigade.
America was aflame with indignation over French injustice.
On September 4, 1798, the Boston Light Infantry was organized
after four months of preliminary meetings&mdash;the
body which today reports to the Adjutant as the 2d Company,
M. C. A. Their motto, “Death or an honorable life,”
is a ringing echo of Charles C. Pinckney’s immortal words,
“Millions for defence; not one cent for tribute.” At the
first banquet of the company, Oct. 18, 1798, when the charter
was received, the principal toast was&mdash;“The United States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of America; as they have drawn the sword of justice with
reason, may they never sheathe it with disgrace.” Would
that this sentiment might always prevail with the authorities
in Washington! Amongst the members present at this banquet
were sons or near relatives of such patriots as Paul
Revere, James Otis and Joseph Warren. Truly the sons
were rallying about the standard of the fathers. Drills were
first held in the old State House, and after 1802 in Faneuil
Hall.</p>

<p>There were lovers of Shakespeare in the Boston Light
Infantry. At a dinner in 1815 one of them gave point to his
speech by quoting the words of Henry V, hero of Agincourt:</p>

<div class="container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0">“In peace, there’s nothing so becomes a man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As modest stillness, and humility:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when the blast of war blows in our ears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then imitate the action of the tiger.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="cont">All of the speech was forgotten except the final words of
the quotation, “The tiger!” Company orators kept repeating
the expression. Ere long the Boston Light Infantry
found itself provided with a nickname&mdash;and it is best known
thruout its long history as “The Tigers.”</p>

<p>In 1800 the Fusiliers under Capt. John Brazer and the
Tigers, Capt. Daniel Sargent (a merchant in civil life),
were the two light infantry companies constituting the sub-legion
of light infantry&mdash;both being entirely independent.
Indeed the sub-legion of light infantry had no field officer
until Feb. 14, 1806, when Capt. Daniel Messinger of the
Winslow Blues was elected Major. The Blues were organized
in 1799 and first appeared on the sub-legion roster in
1802. The Washington Light Infantry were organized
in 1803.</p>

<p>When in 1810 the legionary brigade was transformed into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the 3d Brigade, 1st Division, Maj. Messinger’s sub-legion
of light infantry was broken up and the companies were
distributed amongst the infantry regiments of the brigade.
The Fusiliers and the Washington Lt. Inf. were incorporated
with the 1st Reg., the Tigers with the 2d, and the
Winslow Blues with the 3d. These infantry regiments,
former “legionaries,” were neither train-band militia nor
independent uniformed volunteers. Their status was somewhere
between the two; it was hoped that the light infantry
companies might serve as leaven for the infantry,
and bring all up to the volunteer standard. The arrangement
continued until 1834. By that time it was clear that
only the independent companies, the “light” infantry, retained
any vitality; and they were separated from the infantry
regiments, and organized into a separate “Regiment
of Light Infantry, 3d Brigade.”</p>

<p>Non-commissioned officers of the light infantry companies
manifested active interest in the training school, “The Soul
of the Soldiery,” from 1811 until 1819 and later.</p>

<p>Another company was born amid the war excitement of
1812, the New England Guards. Even from the days of
their first Captain, Samuel Swett, it was felt that a distinguished
destiny awaited the organization. During their entire
half century of existence, they made constant effort to maintain
their personnel at the highest standard; and the effort
was crowned with success. An extant lithograph, in the
museum of the A. &amp; H. Art. Co., shows the Guards in the
year 1836 parading with four platoons of twelve files each&mdash;numbers
indicative of the company’s popularity. They
were added to the 2d Regiment, and thereafter were associated
with the Tigers.</p>

<p>During the war with England the light infantry companies
rendered service at the harbor forts similar to that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
artillery. By request of the commandant of the Charlestown
Navy Yard, the New England Guards were stationed
at the Chelsea bridge for eleven days from June 13, 1814,
in order to prevent an expected raid by a hostile landing
party. The entire membership of the Fusiliers was on duty
from Sept. 12 until Oct. 10, under Capt. Gerry Fairbanks
(a hatter in civil life); and detachments continued doing
garrison duty several weeks longer. The Tigers helped to
build Ft. Strong on Jeffries Point, East Boston; similar
activity characterized the other companies. Massachusetts’
crest is a sword borne by the arm of a civilian: Massachusetts
citizens in 1814 bore the sword effectively and well.</p>

<p>The light infantry companies participated in the same
parades and public festal occasions as did the artillery companies.
These events are elsewhere described in sufficient
detail. In the sterner task of maintaining public order the
New England Guards were on duty twice&mdash;July 7, 1824,
and Feb. 11, 1825,&mdash;in connection with conflagrations. In
both instances personal property had been saved from the
fire and temporarily deposited in a place of safety; and the
troops mounted guard against pillagers. The Tigers subscribed
the first $100 toward the cost of Bunker Hill
monument.</p>

<p>From the disbandment of Maj. Messinger’s battalion in
1810 until the organization of the regiment of light infantry
in 1834, the companies of light infantry were associated only
in the larger unit of the 3d Brigade. While the Coast Artillery
includes all the surviving units of that Brigade, and
altho the 3d Brigade was the most solid and efficient part of
the old militia, still it does not seem wise to treat Brigade
history in particular detail. Suffice it to say that four strong
companies of light infantry continued active in the infantry
regiments of the brigade&mdash;the Fusiliers in the 1st Regiment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the Tigers and the New England Guards in the 2d, and the
Winslow Blues in the 3d. Lists of company commanders
are recorded elsewhere. A new branch of the service came
into existence, the “Rifles,” and were accorded precedence
over others&mdash;were given the right of the line in parades. In
appearance they differed from other troops, as they wore
jaunty green uniforms, and carried short flint-lock rifles
without bayonets. These riflemen aimed to reproduce the
famous corps under Daniel Morgan and others in the Revolutionary
war, the frontiersmen and rangers clad in buckskin
hunting-shirts who were so terrifying to America’s
enemies. It has always seemed strange to the writer that
the frontiersman’s costume, the only distinctively American
garb ever devised, should not continue in use. Not even
these new riflemen, however, succeeded in remaining true to
type. While they were fond of picturing themselves in the
hunting-shirt, the uniforms which they actually wore followed
German models. One valuable contribution the new
rifles did make to militia life, they were pioneers in setting
up target practice as part of the soldier’s training.</p>

<p>Light infantry and rifles were distinguished from other
infantry by the fact that they were trained in the skirmish
drill, and were alone qualified to perform outpost duty. In
line, they formed on the flanks of other companies. From
time to time additional commands aspired to become light
infantry, and some realized their aspirations. By 1834 there
were eight companies altogether in the infantry regiments
who felt dissatisfied with their regimental connection, and
resented the waning interest which regimental neighbors
displayed in things military. Their plan was to separate
from the infantry, and revive the old battalion of light infantry,
whose members should all be volunteers and uniformed,
the battalion which had been broken up in 1810&mdash;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
short, to organize a Light Infantry Regiment in the 3d
Brigade. From the 1st Regiment came the Fusiliers, the
Washington Lt. Infantry and the Mechanic Rifles; from the
2d the Tigers and the New England Guards; and from
the 3d the Winslow Blues, the City Guards (organized Sept.
21, 1821), and the Rifle Rangers (organized 1820). In
1835 a new company was added, the Lafayette Gds.</p>

<p>The new regiment was organized in Aug., 1834, with
eight companies, and Col. Amasa G. Smith of the 2d Regiment
was elected to command. A succession of field officers,
which had begun in 1806 with Major Messinger and had been
interrupted from 1810 until 1834, was thereafter to be continuous.
Col. Smith’s commission was dated July 29, 1834;
he continued in command until Feb. 23, 1838.</p>

<p>Judged by the standards of the day, Col. Smith’s regiment
was a very fine one, indeed was a “crack” command. No
less an authority than President Andrew Jackson is reported
to have testified, “I have never seen its equal.” Most of the
companies wore blue swallow-tail coats and white duck
trousers&mdash;the latter quite regardless of weather; gradually
blue nether garments were added for use on stormy days.
The two rifle companies wore green, the Rangers having
frock coats and uhlan hats; while extant engravings of the
City Guards in 1844, the year of their famous march to Baltimore,
show them clad in gray suits of a pattern precisely
the same as those worn by the New York 7th. The City
Guards were the first corps to wear gray in Boston; and
the Fusiliers were equally distinguished by reason of their
scarlet coats. While there was lack of regimental uniformity,
there must have been a striking ensemble when the companies
formed battalion line.</p>

<p>To the Fusiliers, in June, 1835, fell the honor of introducing
an important tradition into the regiment. For at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
time, after a year’s preparation, they undertook an excursion
to Washington, as a compliment to President Andrew Jackson,
who was soon to give place to Martin Van Buren. The
start was made after partaking of a collation at Gov. John
Davis’ house; progress was made by march, stage, steamboat
and rail; they camped on Capitol Hill; and dined with
Gen. Jackson at the White House. This was not exactly a
trip to “the inauguration,” but it proved to be the commencement
of a custom which today takes the command to Washington
once every four years.</p>

<p>In 1837 a company came into existence which was destined
to prove the temporary undoing of the Light Infantry Regiment,
and was also to subject Boston’s spirit of fairness
and right to its most searching test. The “Montgomery
Guards,” they were called. Altho named after the same
heroic Richard Montgomery who was to give title to another
and more famous company of Montgomery Guards fifteen
years later, they must not be confused with the latter body.
The critical point was that the members were all of Irish
birth; and Boston, for the first time in sixty years, found a
company of foreign soldiery in her midst. At least that was
the view of the matter taken by old-timers. The race prejudice
which later issued in the Know Nothing movement, at
once flamed up. On the other hand, these guardsmen had
all declared their intention of becoming American citizens,
and were entitled to bear arms. The guards were attached
to Col. Smith’s regiment. On Sept. 12, 1837, the date of
the fall field-day and the first assembly of the regiment
since the organization of the Montgomerys, the other nine
companies took post on the regimental line,&mdash;the Montgomerys
arriving last of all. No sooner had the latter swung
into position than the enlisted men of the City Guards, breaking
away from their officers, marched off the Common.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
The enlisted men of the Fusiliers, the Blues, the Mechanics,
the Washingtons and the Lafayettes followed this example
of insubordination and broke ranks. It was sheer mutiny&mdash;mutiny
with which many of the public sympathized, but
mutiny nevertheless.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="smcap">The Gray Uniform&mdash;The City Guards at Baltimore, 1844</span>
</div>

<p>Courts martial resulted, followed by prolonged public
discussion. Presently it became evident that the Boston
sense of fairness and right was strong enough even to meet
this test; and on Feb. 23, 1838, the offending companies were
punished by disbandment. Col. Smith went out of office at
this time. The Montgomery Guards were themselves disbanded
April 6, 1838. As a consequence the Regiment was
reduced to a battalion and placed under the command of
Maj. Charles C. Paine. The Tigers, the New England
Guards, and the Rifle Rangers alone survived the disbandment.</p>

<p>June 1, 1839, found the organization a regiment once
more, made up of the following companies: Tigers, New
England Guards, Pulaski Guards, who now transferred
from the 3d Reg., 3d Bri. (and who seem to have been
temporarily called Mechanic Greys in 1849), Columbian
Greys, Hancock Light Infantry, Rifle Rangers, Highland
Guards and Suffolk Light Guard. As the disbandment
had been intended for punitive purposes merely, encouragement
was held out for the companies to reorganize.
The device of reorganizing and “continuing the record”
was not then thought of. Had it been, it would doubtless
have been ordered; four companies took advantage of the
opportunity. The Columbian Greys were merely the old
City Guards under a new name; in 1844 they appeared on
the records as the City Greys, and by 1851 were known once
more as City Guards. Similarly the Hancock Light Infantry
continued the Fusiliers, the ancient corps being saved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
by the loyalty of two former captains. Noah Lincoln, Jr.,
a prominent Boston shipwright, was in command of the
company when disbanded in 1838. On a May date in 1839
the Hancock Light Infantry elected the same Capt. Lincoln
to be their commander; but he did not deem it best to
accept. On May 17, 1839, the company proceeded to elect
Louis Dennis, a former Captain of Fusiliers who had risen
to field rank; and Maj. Dennis proved his loyalty to the old
corps by accepting a commission as Captain. Maj. Dennis
was a builder in civil life, and felt that the present emergency
called for constructive work along military lines; Capt. Lincoln
thereupon agreed to become 1st Lieutenant of the company.
After four or five years we cease to find reference
to the Hancock Light Infantry&mdash;the records again deal with
the Fusiliers. The Mechanic Rifles similarly reorganized in
1843, and the Washington Light Infantry a few years subsequently.
Col. Charles R. Lowell, formerly Captain of the
Rifle Rangers, commanded the reorganized regiment from
June 1, 1839, until March 20, 1840.</p>

<p>On April 24, 1840, in connection with the general state-wide
reorganization of the militia and the discontinuance of
the train-band, the Light Infantry Regiment, 3d Brigade,
received a number&mdash;it became the 1st Lt. Inf., 1st Brigade.
The following colonels commanded: George W. Phillips,
Aug. 27, 1840&mdash;May 18, 1841; Charles A. Macomber (formerly
captain of the disbanded City Guards), June 15, 1841&mdash;Aug.
24, 1841; George T. Bigelow, formerly captain of the
New England Guards, Sept. 11, 1841&mdash;Jan. 23, 1844; William
H. Spooner, April 15, 1844&mdash;Jan. 19, 1847, the same
Col. Spooner who had commanded the train-band regiment,
the 1st of the 1st Brigade, to which the Roxbury Artillery
was temporarily attached in 1832; Benjamin F. Edmands,
March 15, 1847&mdash;July 11, 1848 (then elected Brig. Gen.);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Col. Samuel Andrews, a former captain of the Tigers, July
28, 1848&mdash;May 13, 1850, when he became Brig. Gen.</p>

<p>When the New York 7th visited Boston in June, 1843,
they were guests of the Fusiliers (yet called Hancock Light
Infantry). After church services on Sunday, June 18, the
visitors were shown around to the chief points of interest.
How fashions do change! The principal shrine to which
pilgrimage was made was&mdash;Mt. Auburn Cemetery.</p>

<p>Veterans of the Mexican War organized a company in the
1st Regiment on June 18, 1849, to which they gave the title,
National Guards; and were the recognized representatives
of the 1st Mass. Mexican War Regiment. Ben Perley Poore,
a prominent newspaper correspondent, was elected Captain.
As it became difficult to secure a sufficient number of Mexican
veterans in Boston, admission was granted to all militia
veterans, after a few years. Capt. Poore presently removed
from Boston for business reasons, and made his residence
in Newburyport. There he became famous as Major of an
independent battalion of infantry; and altho absent from
his Boston comrades, continued to retain a warm place in
their hearts. In Nov., 1856, he had made an election bet
with Col. J. J. Burbank, proprietor of the Tremont House,
Boston, to the effect that Millard Fillmore would get the
Massachusetts electoral vote for President; and lost. So on
Saturday, Nov. 8, he paid the forfeit&mdash;by wheeling a barrel
of apples, on a wheelbarrow, all the way, thirty-six miles,
from Newburyport to Boston. Maj. Poore’s popularity
caused a wide-spread interest to develop in this feat; especially
in Boston were the streets thronged with friendly
spectators. When the Fusiliers learned of the plan, they
determined to have a part in it; so the doughty Major,
himself in citizen’s dress, was met in Charlestown by a
company of thirty-four red-coated soldiers, and solemnly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
escorted across the bridge into Boston. Then, as a slight
recompense for all the fun which had been provided, when
the procession arrived at the Tremont House, the apples
were sold at $1.00 apiece, for the benefit of the man who had
transported them. Maj. Poore’s portrait, as well as two pictures
of the event, are today in the A. &amp; H. Art. Company
museum.</p>

<p>When on April 25, 1842, the companies received distinguishing
letters, the Tigers became Co. A, the New England
Guards B, the Pulaski Guards C, the Highland Guards D,
the City Guards E, the Fusiliers F, the Suffolk Lt. Gds. G,
the Washington Phalanx H, the Rifle Rangers I, and a
company of rifles K.</p>

<p>Charles L. Holbrook became Colonel on Aug. 31, 1850,
and continued in command until Aug. 15, 1854; William
Schouler, destined to be the great Civil War Adjutant General
of Massachusetts, was Lieutenant Colonel. To Col.
Holbrook fell the painful duty of marshalling his regiment
against the mob on June 2, 1854, at the time of the Burns
riot. In that year the organization consisted of eight companies.
To him also fell the more congenial privilege, in
Oct., 1862, of leading his command, the same regiment but
then known as the 43d Mass. Vols., during its campaign in
North Carolina. Col. Holbrook was, in civil life, a bookkeeper,
first in the Suffolk National Bank, and subsequently
in the Custom House; as a soldier he jumped from the
Adjutant’s office to the Colonelcy.</p>

<p>Owing to the formation of new companies it became desirable
to organize an additional battalion of infantry in
1853, to which the number 3d was given. This included
Capt. Poore’s National Guards as Co. A, the Union Guards
of East Boston, organized in 1852, as Co. B, and the Sarsfield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Guards as Co. C, all under command of Maj. Robert
I. Burbank.</p>

<p>Col. Thomas E. Chickering commanded the 1st Regiment
from Oct. 25, 1854, until Jan. 29, 1856; and during his administration
the name of the organization was changed from
Light Infantry to “Infantry.” Col. Chickering commanded
the 41st Mass. Inf., which became the 3d Cavalry, 1862-1865,
and served in the department of the Gulf, transferring to
Gen. P. H. Sheridan in Virginia during 1864. In 1855 the
3d Battalion of Infantry disbanded, the National and Union
Guards going into the 2d Regiment as 9th and 6th Cos. respectively,
while the Sarsfield Guards passed out of existence.
The transfer of two strong companies to the 2d was
a sign that the latter regiment was increasing while the 1st
decreased. Six years later the 2d was to receive the much-desired
number which had thitherto belonged to the “1st.”
Maj. Joseph Bradley had become commander of the 3d Battalion
at the time of its disbanding.</p>

<p>Col. Robert I. Burbank, formerly of the 3d Battalion, was
the last commander of the old 1st Regiment, serving from
March 25, 1856, until March 2, 1859. The regiment had
several strong companies and might have been the leading
military body in Boston; but it suffered from an excess
of company loyalty and an utter absence of regimental spirit.
Moreover there was a tendency to elect men of political
prominence to the chief command, with slight regard for
their military talents. Colonels were changed too frequently.
The 2d Regiment under Cols. Bullock and Cowdin presented
a striking contrast to the 1st in these particulars. The military
authorities, since they recognized the inevitable tendency
of the times, disbanded the 1st Regiment, and transferred
four of the seven companies to the 2d, on March 1,
1859. The companies to enter the 2d Regiment were: C,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the Pulaski Guards; D, the Washington Light Guard;
F, the Fusiliers; and H, the Mechanic Rifles; these became
the 4th, 2d, 3d, and 5th Companies in Col. Cowdin’s regiment.
The three companies remaining of the old 1st&mdash;the
Tigers, the New England Guards, and the City Guards&mdash;were
reorganized as the 2d Battalion of Infantry, under
command of Maj. Charles O. Rogers, former captain of the
Tigers. The latter command were highly prosperous at this
time; in 1858 we find them giving the first grand ball ever
held in the Music Hall, and a year later enlarging the scope
of their social activities by moving the function into the
Boston Theater, the first such event ever held in that celebrated
amusement center.</p>

<p>Sentiment assumed striking forms in the military life of
Boston during the years preceding the Civil War. Two
visiting military bodies, the New York 7th in 1857 and the
Ellsworth Zouaves from Chicago in July, 1860, presented
such examples of military efficiency that a desire grew up&mdash;was
encouraged by the Adjutant General&mdash;for the formation
of a “crack” regiment in Boston. At the same time, the
designation, “4th Battalion,” came to be coveted and sought
after. The reason for the latter sentiment is obscure; there
never had been a 4th Battalion in Boston, never any of
prominence in Massachusetts. But the old sub-legion of Lt.
Infantry in the 3d Brigade, standing as it did beside three
infantry sub-legions, and brilliantly outclassing them, had
been a “4th battalion” of which all Boston was proud. From
1859 on, many organizations were attempting to secure the
designation, “4th Battalion.”</p>

<p>The 2d Battalion, organized March 1, 1859, under Maj.
Rogers, included three strong companies, and might have
been the nucleus of the desired “crack” organization; however
the units did not cohere, and the battalion speedily flew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to pieces. Maj. Harrison Ritchie of the New England Gds.
became commander July 21, 1860.</p>

<p>Gen. Samuel H. Leonard had removed from Worcester
to Boston for business reasons, and had thereby lost his
brigade in the former county. Becoming associated with
Boston military men who were ambitious for a new and
highly efficient regiment, he placed himself at the head of
the movement. Ex-Gen. Leonard presently succeeded Capt.
Clark B. Baldwin in command of the Boston Artillery, and
proceeded to transfer that company from Col. Cowdin’s 2d
Regiment to a new battalion. The City Guards had disbanded
Dec. 26, 1859, and most of the members went into
the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company; now former
members of the City Guards were reenlisted and consolidated
with the Boston Artillery. Indeed these City Guardsmen
were the instigators of the movement. Capt. Augustine
Harlow (a printer in civil life), formerly in command of
the National Guards, the 9th Company of the 2d Reg.,
joined in the movement and organized a new company. On
Dec. 15, 1860, Capt. Leonard’s as Co. A, Capt. Harlow’s as
Co. D, and two new companies designated B and C were
associated as the 4th Battalion. At length the much desired
numeral was in use,&mdash;and by men of large military ability
and soaring ambition. Since “rifles” took precedence over
other branches, the new battalion became “Rifles”; and wore
gray Zouave or chasseur uniforms. We have seen elsewhere
how this movement became deflected by the call for
volunteers, and ultimately issued in the splendid 13th Mass.
Inf. If the 4th Battalion of Rifles did not become a “crack”
regiment&mdash;it achieved a nobler destiny.</p>

<p>On March 11, 1861, the New England Guards became independent
of Maj. Ritchie’s 2d Battalion; and expanded
their organization into a two-company battalion, for which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
they claimed the coveted numeral, becoming the 4th Battalion
of Infantry; Capt. Thomas G. Stevenson of the New
Englanders became Major, and was in fact the leader of the
movement. The ensuing month brought war and put an
end to the militia dreams. On April 25 Maj. Stevenson’s
battalion entered upon a one-month tour of volunteer garrison
duty at Ft. Independence, the men serving without
pay. It was at this time that they achieved the distinction
of “bringing out” the most famous band-leader of the generation,
Patrick S. Gilmore. Gilmore’s music and the fine
marching of the New England Guards battalion immediately
brought Maj. Stevenson’s command a high degree of
popularity.</p>

<p>More three-year regiments were needed in the autumn of
1861, and members of the New England Guards battalion
decided to enlist. Upon further thought it seemed wiser to
use their proved skill in military matters in a higher capacity&mdash;they
would organize a new regiment of recruits, and
themselves go as officers. With the approval of the War
Department, accordingly, the 24th Mass. Reg. came into
existence, having Thomas G. Stevenson as Colonel and Gilmore
as band-leader. No prophet then foresaw the future;
but a bronze bas-relief in the State House (erected in 1905)
today reminds us of the record of heroic service in North
Carolina, South Carolina and Florida; the transfer to Virginia
May 1, 1864, and participation with the Army of the
James in the operations around Petersburg and Richmond.
Their commander, now Gen. Stevenson, was killed in battle
at Spotsylvania. Gilmore continued with his regiment as
long as the Government permitted regimental bands&mdash;during
the entire first year of the service.</p>

<p>Members of the New England Guards who were unable,
for business or family reasons, to go for three years, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
quick to respond, in the autumn of 1862, to the call for nine-months
men. Part of the 4th Battalion had organized and
officered the 24th Regiment (there was already a 4th Reg.)&mdash;clinging
to the coveted numeral others now raised the 44th
Reg. and followed their comrades&mdash;to the coast of North
Carolina. So very few New England Guardsmen were left
at home in Boston that the battalion passed out of existence&mdash;died
of patriotism.</p>

<p>Maj. Ralph W. Newton, former captain of the Tigers,
succeeded Maj. Ritchie in command of the 2d Battalion on
Apr. 17, 1861, and continued in office until May 22, 1862.
Nothing remained of the old 1st Reg., or of the 2d Bat.,
except the Tiger company. In order to retain the battalion
organization, the Tigers sub-divided into three companies.
From this point on it will be literally correct to designate
the battalion organization, the sole surviving remnant of
the old 1st, as the Tigers.</p>

<p>On April 29, twelve days after assuming command, Maj.
Newton moved his Tiger battalion to Fort Warren, and remained
there a full month rendering unpaid volunteer service.
Owing to the extreme shortage of trained soldiers,
the Government was glad to have the services of the battalion
at Boston’s most important fort. Old Andrew
Fletcher has claimed that the song-writer of a nation is more
influential even than the law-maker. So far as this is true,
the 2d Company, the Tigers, have exerted a huge national
influence. For while at Warren, it fell to the lot of their
glee-club to originate one of America’s greatest war-songs,
one which until “Marching thru Georgia” was composed,
stood supreme, the song, “John Brown’s Body.” Both
words and tune trace back to the 2d Company. The tune
is an adaptation of a southern revival hymn familiar before
the war; but is so complete a revision as to be practically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
an original composition. The words were written as a joke
on Private John Brown of the Tigers, who always seemed
a shining mark for the wit of his comrades, and whose
name of course suggested the hero of Osawatomie and
Harper’s Ferry. Fletcher Webster’s regiment, the 12th,
was in process of recruiting at Fort Warren that month.
This song, at first intended humorously, was taken up in
serious earnest by Webster’s men, was sung a little later by
them as they marched to Bull Run; and within a year hundreds
of thousands in blue were firing their enthusiasm for
battle with the great refrain, “His soul is marching on.”</p>

<p>Ex-Col. Charles L. Holbrook proved his loyalty to his old
command by accepting the lower office of Major on June
23, 1862. This responsibility he did not lay down until Oct.
13, 1862, when he led the 43d Reg. to war.</p>

<p>To the Tigers, as to others of Boston’s best citizens, the
call for nine-months men came as a personal summons to
service. Maj. Holbrook’s 2d Battalion at once began enlisting
recruits, until it had expanded to a complete ten-company
regiment. Practically all the officers were chosen from
the Tiger battalion; and the new regiment, the 43d, was
known as the “Tiger Regiment.” The ancient title, “Boston
Light Infantry,” had remained attached to Co. A of the
2d Battalion;&mdash;now the “Lt. Inf.” Co. transferred itself bodily
to the new regiment, and became Co. A of the 43d. Company
commanders were: A, Henry J. Hallgreen; B, Edward
G. Quincy; C, William B. Fowle, Jr.; D, Thomas G. Whytal
(Capt. Whytal later became a Lt. Col. of U. S. Vols.); E,
Henry Doane (of Orleans); F, Charles W. Soule; G,
Everett Lane (of Abington, who was elected Major Oct.
20, 1862); H, George B. Hanover (of Chelsea); I, George
O. Tyler (of Cambridge); K, J. Emery Round. Maj. Holbrook,
as we have already seen, became colonel. John C.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Whiton, who later was Colonel of the 58th Mass., was Lt.
Col., and Everett Lane, Major. Co. D was from Dedham,
E from Orleans, G from Abington, H from Chelsea and
I from Cambridge. The other companies were recruited at
large&mdash;that is, from Boston. The regiment was mustered
in Sept. 20, 1862.</p>

<p>Co. H of the 43d had an origin prophetic of the regimental
consolidation which was to give us the present Coast Artillery.
Springing as it did from the membership, and commanded
as it was by the 1st Lieutenant of the Chelsea Rifles,
and they in turn being the “depot” or reserve company of
the Chelsea Volunteers (the 5th Co. in the three-year 1st
Regiment), Co. H was in direct relationship with both of
these commands. After the war, veterans of all three companies
joined forces, transformed the Rifles into the “Chelsea
Veterans,” and thus created our present 5th Company,
M. C. A. For three years it was actually made up exclusively
of veterans.</p>

<p>Tiger veterans and friends joined in giving the 43d a
notable “send-off.” Once more the motto was “Death or
an honorable life.” The historic banquet of Oct. 18, 1798,
was repeated on Nov. 5, 1862, and the famous toast was
again drunk, “The United States of America; as they have
drawn the sword of justice with reason, may they never
sheathe it with disgrace.” Hon. R. C. Winthrop, standing
on Boston Common, presented the regiment a handsome
stand of colors, a gift from the Boston Light Infantry.</p>

<p>A few weeks later the 43d found themselves under Gen.
John T. Foster in North Carolina, far indeed from Boston
and their friends, but side by side with the 3d and 44th Regs.,
which also enter into our history. The old Tiger spirit had
accompanied them. In Dec, 1862, came their great march
thru the swamps and sand barrens, when they were face to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
face with the enemy during eleven continuous days. They
were able to claim as their list of battles, Kinston, Whitehall
and Goldsboro.</p>

<p>The loss of the North Carolina coast was a great blow
to the Confederacy, opening as it did the way for Sherman’s
march northward. Foster’s army was really an outpost of
the greater force threatening Richmond.</p>

<p>In July, 1863, their service was completed and they were
homeward bound once more. Travelling by boat to Baltimore,
stopping for a visit at Fort Monroe, thence by train
to New York, and having a square meal en route at Philadelphia,
by boat to New Haven and train to Boston, they
were given a hearty welcome home at old Boylston Hall, the
Tiger armory, on July 21. The Boston Light Infantry at
once became the 24th Unattached Company, M. V. M.</p>

<p>A few months of quiescence succeeded the Tigers’ nine
months of duty in the 43d. Not until Aug., 1864, is there
record of further activity. The war was drawing to a close,
the nine-months regiments had been mustered out and the
three-year commands were returning. Once more the ambition
to have a “crack” regiment was stirring in Boston.
Veteran and exempt members of the Tigers had formed the
“Boston Lt. Inf. Assn.,” Nov. 1, 1862, during the absence of
the active company. On this August date in 1864 the Light
Infantry reorganized themselves as the “7th Infantry.”
Maj. Charles O. Rogers, first commander of the 2d Battalion,
was offered the colonelcy but declined; Daniel G.
Handy was then elected, and received his commission on
Nov. 6, 1865. (Col. Handy had been Maj. of the 12th Mass.
in 1861 and 1862&mdash;indeed had been with the recruits in Ft.
Warren when “John Brown’s Body” originated.) A vigorous
attempt was made to form new companies and maintain
the 7th at regimental standard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>The 7th Mass. Inf., a Taunton command, had made a
noble name for itself during three years of hard service;
and had been mustered out just before the Tiger 7th came
into existence. The traditions connected with the number
were certain to prove stimulating. But the choice of a number
had further significance; it was a deliberate attempt to
reproduce the New York 7th. Gilmore became band-leader,
and it was hoped that his famous musicians would lend
brilliancy to the new regiment. It was in his capacity as
leader of the 7th Regiment band that Gilmore arranged
and conducted his first “Peace Jubilee Festival” in 1869,
with ten thousand singers and eight hundred instrumentalists
in a “coliseum” seating fifty thousand, and not exceeded
in size even by Billy Sunday’s tabernacle of 1916. Music
by wholesale, this, and very different from the original classical
“Peace Jubilee” in King’s Chapel, Feb. 22, 1815, from
which Gilmore obtained the suggestion. New England liked
it; and derived benefit from the popularization of good
music. And the 7th received no little advertising.</p>

<p>Nine new companies came into existence within two years,
mostly by the process of subdividing older commands, while
the Tigers continued their organization as Co. A. Charles
F. Harrington, former Captain of the Tigers, became
colonel in 1869. Distinguished soldiers were willing to
serve as company commanders in the 7th. B had for a
Captain, Walter Scott Sampson, who had led the 7th Co. of
Col. Cowdin’s regiment, the Washington Light Guard, into
the 6th, and had commanded it (Co. K of the 6th) during
its famous march thru Baltimore. Capt. Sampson had
meanwhile been in command of a company in the 22d Mass.
He was, in civil life, a successful Boston builder. E was
commanded by no less a personage than Henry J. Hallgreen,
war Captain of A or the Tiger Company in the 43d. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
had for its Captain, David W. Wardrop, war Colonel of the
3d Reg. The entire regiment was quartered in a single
armory, at Pine and Washington Sts. Co. B had developed
by fission from Co. A in 1864 and was first called the Handy
Guard or 32d Unattached Co. In 1869 so many veterans
of the old Washington Light Guard joined Co. B that the
Handy Guard became known as the Washington Light
Guard. In 1873 the company transferred its headquarters
from Boston to Cambridge, and, as part of the process, the
name was again changed, becoming the Massachusetts
Guards. Claim has been made that Co. B perpetuates the
old original Washington Light Guard, and it also claims to
be the Tigers, as truly as the 2d Company;&mdash;it exists today
as the 6th Company, Mass. C. A. Gen. W. E. Lombard
holds its older record books. The 7th Company, Mass.
C. A., the Pierce Light Guard, came into existence as Co. E
of the 7th; Henry L. Pierce after whom it was named
donated $1,000 to the company treasury.</p>

<p>Young men, however, are more successful than veterans
in maintaining the interest of an active regiment; and
apathy concerning <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'miltary'">military</ins> matters characterized the public
thinking during the years immediately following the war.
By 1870 the 7th had only four live companies remaining;
on July 20 of that year the regiment was reduced to a battalion.
The Tigers now recovered their old regimental number&mdash;they
became the “1st” Battalion, and Maj. Douglass
Frazer commanded. The 1st Battalion was on duty in 1872
at the great Boston fire, and protected the most important
section of all, the financial district along State Street.</p>

<p>Austin C. Wellington, formerly 1st Lieutenant in the 38th
Mass., became captain of the Tiger Co. A in 1870, and with
his advent began the era of prosperity and efficiency for
which the Tigers had long been wishing. In 1873 Wellington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
became Major of the battalion, and on March 25, 1874,
came a change in designation, bringing, after failure to get
back their war number, 2d, the long-coveted numeral, “4th.”
As an indication of how this ambition had persisted from
ante-bellum days, we find the organization, in 1875, unofficially
describing itself as the 4th Battalion “of Rifles.”
In 1872 the “Maverick Rifles” had been organized as Co. D
of this battalion; today they are the 11th Co., Mass. C. A.</p>

<p>It was the privilege of the Tigers, in 1875, to receive and
entertain the Old Guard of New York City and the Washington
Lt. Infantry of Charleston, South Carolina, the latter
being the first southern military body to visit the north after
the war. The following year the Tigers and Old Guard
returned this courtesy, visiting Charleston and assisting in
the celebration of the centennial of the battle of Fort
Moultrie on June 28.</p>

<p>It was at once appreciated that Boston had a “crack”
battalion and Maj. Wellington’s command was in great demand
for parades and reviews. Its drill became a standard
for other infantry bodies, while its striking quasi-Zouave
uniform made such an impression upon the authorities that
the costume was, in 1884, adopted as the State uniform.
Such was the 4th Battalion which, on Dec. 3, 1878, by a
process of consolidation, became part of the 1st Regiment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>“THE CAPE”</h3>


<p>During the train-band days, the troops of Plymouth and
Bristol counties, with the Cape and Islands, constituted the
5th Division, while Boston militia made up the 1st. When
the volunteer militia was set apart as the principal defence
of the state, both sections found themselves in the same division.
Now the Cape was the 2d Brigade while Boston was
the 1st. By the consolidation of 1878 the two were finally
brought together into the same regiment, so that the Coast
Artillery not only perpetuates the old Legionary Brigade,
but also the old 2d Brigade, M. V. M., and the older 5th
Division.</p>

<p>There were four regiments of infantry in the 1st Brigade,
5th Division, of the train-band. The Halifax Light Infantry,
organized in 1792, attached to the 1st of these, was the
first company in the entire district to rise from the condition
of militia to that of volunteers; and presently became the
senior member of the Light Infantry Regiment. During its
long career from 1792 until 1876, the Halifax Light Infantry
was always one of the foremost military bodies in
Plymouth County, and indeed in the entire state. Capt. Asa
Thompson, who commanded in 1814, and who led his men
into the 1st Division territory for the purpose of assisting
to build and garrison Boston forts, was a giant (a “Saul”
in the Scriptural language of the day), six feet, seven inches
in stature. The towering head-dress of the times brought
his height up to eight feet. As he led his men across South
Boston bridge on the way to the forts and duty, every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
stopped to look and admire,&mdash;and wonder whether the bridge
could stand up beneath the load. Alas! Captain Thompson
presently fell into disgrace, and was dismissed by court-martial.</p>

<p>Oct. 21, 1818, patriotic citizens of Plymouth met and organized
a light infantry company, to which they gave the
name, Standish Guards, in compliment to the great “Captain
of Plymouth.” Coomer Weston was elected Captain,
James H. Holmes, Lieutenant, and William Randall, Ensign.
Under the drill regulations of the period, the captain
marched at the head of the column, the lieutenant at the
rear, and the ensign in the center, carrying the flag. The
most notable early parade of the Guards occurred on Dec.
22, 1820, when they escorted the Pilgrim Society, and
Daniel Webster as orator of the day, in commemoration of
the bi-centenary of the Fathers’ landing. To be sure, the
date is now known to be one day too late; but no error of
detail could prevent the occasion from being one long worth
remembering.</p>

<p>As regards personnel, the Cape companies did not differ
from those in Boston; prosperous merchants and tradesmen
and mechanics made up the bulk of their membership;
moreover a certain percentage of farmers were enrolled.
There was less opportunity for social interchange and less
of the stimulus arising from competition, owing to the relative
smallness of the cities and towns. But in general the
constituent organizations of the 3d Regiment passed thru the
same experiences as did their sister companies to the northward.
It will therefore not be necessary to repeat the details
of events as outlined in previous chapters; we need only
speak of those matters which were distinctive of the Cape.</p>

<p>By 1834 the train-band was in a very bad way indeed,
and was rapidly approaching the moment of its extinction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Ambitious companies were transferring to the light infantry,
in order to distinguish themselves from their older and inefficient
companions. Marshfield and Scituate had rifle companies
and Scituate and Pembroke light infantry companies
in connection with the 2d train-band Regiment; Abington
had rifles, grenadiers and light infantry, and West Bridgewater
light infantry in the 3d Regiment; and Middleboro
had grenadiers in the 4th Regiment. In September of that
year an order was issued separating the volunteer companies
from the train-band regiments, and establishing them as a
“Regiment of Light Infantry, 1st Brigade, 5th Division.”
The nine companies mentioned, with the Halifax Lt. Inf.
and the Standish Guards, constituted this new regiment.
The organization is interesting because it ultimately became
the 3d Regiment, and finally was consolidated in the Coast
Artillery. The Samoset Rifles or Guards were organized
in 1835 and were presently added to the regiment.</p>

<p>On April 24, 1840, the command became the 3d Regiment
of Light Infantry, 2d Brigade, 1st Division. When on
April 25, 1842, the companies received distinguishing letters,
the following units existed with vitality sufficient to
survive the transition: A, Halifax Light Infantry; B, Plymouth,
Standish Guards; C, Hanson Rifles (a new company);
D, Abington Light Infantry; E, Middleboro Grenadiers; F,
Wareham Grenadiers (a new company); and G, Abington
Rifles. At that date the New Bedford and Fall River companies
were in the 2d Battalion of Light Infantry, as was
also the company of Taunton Rifles. Taunton subsequently
fell within the district of the 4th Regiment, a command
which was by its location mainly an overflow from the 3d,
and which a quarter century later merged in the 3d.</p>

<p>Col. Gideon W. Young of Scituate, who had commanded
the 2d Regiment in the train-band brigade, was chosen first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
commander of the Light Infantry regiment. Col. John
Cushing, Jr., of Abington, succeeded Col. Young and served
from May 20, 1837, until May 13, 1839. Col. Nahum Reynolds
of North Bridgewater came next, receiving his commission
Aug. 31, 1839. Col. Henry Dunham of Abington followed
on March 25, 1841, being first to receive commission
as Colonel of the “3d” Regiment. Presently Col. Dunham
was chosen Brigadier General. During the administration
of Col. Albert Whitmarsh of Abington, Aug. 1, 1842, to
May 1, 1844, new companies were organized in Middleboro
and Abington, while the Wareham Grenadiers disappeared
from the records. The original New Bedford City
Guards were organized in 1842, with Capt. George A.
Bourne in command; and in 1846 they became Co. K of the
3d Regiment. During their first year, the Guards paid a visit
to the Rifle Rangers of Boston. The occasion inspired
someone to compose the “Whaleman’s Quickstep.” While
we are not today interested in this as music, still it finds
place in all our bibliographies because, on the front
cover, it bears a picture of the two companies mustered on
Boston Common. The Rifle Rangers stand in line as the
New Bedford Guards march past, straight in the direction
of the large refreshment tent which bounds the vista. New
Bedford’s company paraded in four platoons of eight files&mdash;a
fact indicative of a large membership. The City Guards
were disbanded in 1849.</p>

<p>Eliab Ward of Middleboro was Colonel from July 10,
1844, until April 10, 1850, an unusually long term.
Elnathan Wilbur of Middleboro was Colonel from May 4,
1850, till Jan. 28, 1853; Col. Stephen Thomas of Middleboro
succeeded Col. Wilbur and remained in office from
March 12, 1853, until Apr. 8, 1858. While companies were
disbanded in Plymouth county, the loss was made good by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the formation of new units in Bristol county. On June 29,
1850, the Assonet Light Infantry of Freetown came into existence&mdash;a
company destined to go to war eleven years later
with only twenty-one enlisted men, equipped with ancient
bullets which had been moulded for use in suppressing
Shays’ rebellion. Yet one of their members was to have the
distinction of bringing in, at Fort Monroe, the first three
escaped slaves or “contrabands.” July 22, 1852, was the
birthday of the new City Guards of New Bedford, commanded
by the same Capt. Bourne who led the former company.
This organization is today the 4th Company, Mass.
C. A. On Feb. 26, 1855, the regiment was redesignated the
“3d Regiment of Infantry.”</p>

<p>David W. Wardrop of New Bedford, June 26, 1858, John
H. Jennings of New Bedford, May 10, 1862, until Aug. 25,
1862, and Silas P. Richmond of Freetown, Oct. 7, 1862,
were the war Colonels of the 3d. Col. Wardrop was a
Philadelphian by birth, but in young manhood removed to
New Bedford. For a time he was a cadet at West Point.
During a temporary residence in Boston he had been a
member of the Fusiliers. In his home city he served in
the City Guards, and was connected with the whaling industries
of the port. Following the three-months’ service
with the 3d, he became Colonel of the 99th New York Volunteers;
and after the war he was inspector of customs at
Boston. Col. Richmond had been a charter member of the
Assonet Lt. Inf., and subsequently its Captain. Giving up
his farm in 1857, he spent a year with John Brown in Kansas
repelling “border ruffians.” During the three-months’ tour
of duty, as we shall see, he was captain on the brigade staff;
under Col. Jennings he was Lieutenant Colonel. At the
conclusion of his nine-months’ service, he became Colonel
of the 58th Mass. and Assistant Provost Marshal General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
of the Department of the South. After the war he returned
to Freetown, and continued active in business and political
spheres.</p>

<p>Col. Wardrop’s regiment received orders to mobilize at
Boston on the evening of Monday, Apr. 15, 1861. As the
headquarters of the 3d were more remote from Boston than
those of any other regiment called out, a severe handicap
rested upon the command. Its members were mostly busy
farmers or mechanics. Furthermore a cold, spring northeaster
was raging and roads were almost impassable because
of mud. Yet the energy of the colonel and his staff
officers and the loyalty of the men overcame these difficulties,
and enabled the regiment to report in Boston on the 16th&mdash;as
early as any of those residing nearer. Credit must be
given to Pres. Horace Scott of the Fairhaven Railroad for
free use of a special train on the night of April 15, by which
alone the prompt circulation of the order became possible;
but the real praise belongs to the officers and men of the
companies, whose patriotism produced the magnificent response.
The six companies of the regiment, together with
a Cambridge company which was attached, embarked on
the steamer, “S. R. Spalding,” April 17, and lay in the harbor
that night awaiting supplies. When on the following
morning final drafts of men had arrived, bringing the total
up to more than five hundred, the steamer sailed under sealed
orders; and found, when nine miles out, that her destination
was Fort Monroe. As communication with Washington
was temporarily interrupted, these orders emanated from
Gov. Andrew and are a mark of his patriotic sagacity; Gen.
John E. Wool, in command of Fort Monroe, had sent a
messenger by water requesting help. The officers of the
regiment were, besides Col. Wardrop; Lieutenant Colonel
Charles Raymond, a former captain of the Standish Guards;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Major John H. Jennings of New Bedford; Captains, Co. A,
Joseph S. Harlow, who, like his predecessor of 1814, was
well over six feet in height; B, Charles C. Doten of Plymouth
(afterwards Captain of Co. G, in the 38th Mass., and
today Secretary of the Pilgrim Society); C, the Cambridge
company, Capt. James P. Richardson; G, John W. Marble
of Assonet; H, Lucien L. Perkins of Plympton; K, William
S. McFarlin of South Carver (subsequently Captain of Co.
C, 18th Mass. Vol. Inf.); and L, Timothy Ingraham of New
Bedford. Four new companies were later added to the regiment;
and after the expiration of the three-months’ service,
these became the nucleus of the 29th Regiment. Companies
from the 4th Regiment also joined the 29th. As the 4th
Regiment was included in the expedition to Fort Monroe,
going by boat from New York, and thus both units of the
2d Brigade, 1st Division, M. V. M., were involved, Gen.
Ebenezer W. Peirce, of Freetown, went as brigade commander;
and on his staff was Capt. Silas P. Richmond.
The 3d Regiment had worn gray uniforms since 1845, and
after the war were to continue the color until 1874. So
we may picture them as clad in that dressy yet serviceable
garb.</p>

<p>Fort Monroe, often called “Fortress” Monroe to indicate
that it consists of a fort within a fort, is known as the
“Gibraltar of America.” Certainly it is a tribute to the political
power of the dominant “House of Virginia” in the
early days of our Republic, that the largest and strongest
fortification of all should be erected for the defence of Norfolk
and the James river. Incidentally it affords some protection
to Washington and Baltimore; but that was not a
controlling consideration in 1819, when construction began,
nor in 1830, when the work was completed. Monroe is a
five-bastioned fort of masonry work, and accordingly might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
be roughly described as a huge pentagon. The walls surrounding
it extend for the almost incredible distance of two
miles, while the enclosed area is eighty acres in extent. Two
picturesque features are the clumps of live oaks growing
on the parade, which are not found anywhere farther north,
and the sea-water moat in which tide-gates hold the water
at a constant depth of six feet.</p>

<p>Such a fort is impregnable when adequately garrisoned&mdash;Monroe
requires at least fifteen hundred men to render her
secure. A Secretary of War with southern sympathies had
stripped the fort of soldiers, until little more than a caretakers’
party remained. This tiny regular garrison was
compelled to keep all its members under arms continually
in order to man the guard-posts. Part of the moat had become
an oyster-bed and was so filled up as to be fordable.</p>

<p>Sailing from Boston on the 18th, the men of the 3d experienced
rough weather rounding Cape Cod. The last meal
the soldiers had eaten before leaving Boston harbor did
them no permanent good. Just as in a rambling conversation,
so with landsmen on the ocean&mdash;one thing brings up
another. On the historic 19th of April, while the 6th was
fighting its way thru Baltimore and the N. Y. 7th was receiving
an ovation along Broadway, the 3d and 4th were
enjoying (?) life on the ocean wave. All things, however,
have an end; and the 20th found both transports off Monroe,
at the entrance of the Chesapeake bay. At first they
were uncertain whether the fort remained in loyal hands
or not; but the morning gun fired as a salute, and “old
glory” ascending the staff, soon reassured them. No troops
were ever more heartily welcomed than were the Massachusetts
militiamen by the regulars of the garrison. First
the 4th and then the 3d marched thru the sally-port, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
bivouacked beneath the live oaks; America’s most important
fort was manned by loyal troops.</p>

<p>After barely time to snatch a luncheon and reassure themselves
that such a thing as solid ground existed, the 3d was
ordered under arms. Commodore Paulding had just arrived
from Washington in the S. S. “Pawnee,” with orders to
secure soldiers, and proceed to Norfolk for the purpose of
destroying the Gosport Navy Yard. Norfolk lay far within
the newly established Confederate lines. Across Hampton
Roads, up the Elizabeth river, past Sewell’s Point where the
exposition of 1907 was to stand and where in 1861 the Confederates
were erecting an earthwork, past Fort Norfolk,
which was then held by Confederates, the “Pawnee” proceeded
in cool disregard of threatened shot and shell. It
was nine <span class="smcap lowercase">P. M.</span> when the Navy Yard was reached, and here
another peril became imminent. The tiny crew and garrison
of the Yard were at their guns, not knowing whether the
“Pawnee” were an attacking Confederate or a Union reinforcement.
Presently, however, identity was cleared up,
and the principal business of the night was allowed to proceed.</p>

<p>A Secretary of the Navy, a southern sympathizer, had
accumulated ships and material at Gosport worth not less
than $10,000,000, for the express purpose of allowing them
to fall into Confederate hands. It was the duty of Commodore
Paulding and Col. Wardrop to prevent such a disastrous
consummation. Both officers felt that the Yard could
be held against hostile attack; but their orders were explicit&mdash;to
destroy and abandon. History has decided that the
destruction might have been avoided. As, however, the
leaders of the expedition had no choice, they endeavored
to make the destruction complete. The “Merrimac” was set
afire and sunk. Everything that would not burn was thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
overboard. At 3 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. M.</span> Sunday, the men of the 3d, tired
and smoke-begrimed, reembarked on the “Pawnee”; and
towing the “Cumberland,” with the Navy Yard garrison on
board, started down the Elizabeth river, leaving a raging
hell of flames behind them. While the regiment had not
been permitted to remain and hold Gosport as they desired,
they had been the first northern troops to engage actively
in military operations within hostile territory.</p>

<p>By the middle of May the four additional companies had
arrived and joined the regiment. Gen. B. F. Butler, having
completed his task of pacifying Baltimore, came to Monroe
as Major General in command of the “Department of Virginia
and North Carolina.” On May 24, Private Charles
R. Haskins of Co. G (Assonet) had the honor of bringing
in the first escaped negro slaves who reached the Union
lines, Haskins being on guard at the time in Hampton. By
one of the happy flights of practical genius for which he
was distinguished, Gen. Butler decided that he could not
return the run-aways because they were “contraband of
war.” The north had been waiting in anxious suspense to
know what would happen when southern slave-owners
should demand the return of their property. Very much
depended upon the decision of the question. Men certainly
would refuse to enlist in the Union armies if they were
thereby to become slave-drivers. Butler’s decision caused
a sigh of relief thruout the loyal states. It must not be forgotten
that this first long step toward ultimate emancipation
was taken in connection with the activity of the 3d Regiment.</p>

<p>One can scarcely overestimate the importance of these
early days at Monroe. The fort has always been the coast
artillery headquarters of the United States. During the
Civil War it was far more than this&mdash;it was the gateway
of Virginia. Its possession enabled McClellan and Grant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
to operate against Richmond. Without it neither the Peninsular
campaign nor the siege of Petersburg could have taken
place. Nearby Hampton, fanned by the sea-breezes, became
the sanitorium of the northern armies. Burnside’s expedition,
which made possible Sherman’s march, depended upon
Monroe as a base. When on July 16, five days after the
4th Regiment had departed, the men of the 3d embarked on
the S. S. “Cambridge” to sail for Boston, they felt with
reason that they had rendered priceless service to their
country.</p>

<p>One company of the 4th Regiment, Co. G, which served
three months at Fort Monroe, and subsequently for nine
months of 1862-63 at New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Port
Hudson, became, in 1866, Co. G of the 3d; and in 1878 was
consolidated in the 1st. Co. G had been organized at Taunton
as the “Light Guard” in 1855.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1862 a call came for nine-months troops.
The companies of the 3d had maintained their organization,
and altho constantly depleted to supply recruits for other
regiments, were relatively well prepared for service. They
now determined that the 3d should reenter the U. S. service.
In order to distribute town quotas more justly, the Assonet
Light Infantry was united with the Halifax Light Infantry
as Co. A, under Capt. John W. Marble of Assonet; (Capt.
Marble was subsequently to command the 22d Unattached
Company during the one-hundred-days of 1864;) the Samoset
Guards of Plympton and the Bay State Light Infantry
of Carver were consolidated with the Standish Guards as
Co. B, under Capt. Thomas B. Griffith of Carver. The New
Bedford City Guards became Co. E, under Capt. John A.
Hawes. New companies were organized: C and D in Fall
River under Capts. Elihu Grant and Andrew D. Wright
(Capt. Grant later became a minister); F and G in New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Bedford under Capts. George H. Hurlburt and William S.
Cobb; H in Rehoboth under Capt. Otis A. Baker, who had
a notable war record. (As private in the 1st R. I., he had
been wounded at Bull Run. Later he had served as 1st
Sergeant and 2d Lieutenant in the 44th R. I.; subsequently
he was to be Captain of the 18th Unattached Company,)
I in Fairhaven under Capt. Barnabas Ewer, Jr., who as
Major of the 58th Mass. was killed at Cold Harbor in 1864;
K in Bridgewater under Capt. Samuel Bates. Co. D of Fall
River continued its existence after the war, and was active
until 1876. The regiment was commanded by Col. Richmond;
the Lieutenant Colonel was James Barton of New
Bedford, who had been 1st Lieutenant during the three-months’
service; the Major was John Morrissey of Plymouth,
who had been “legislated out” of the captaincy of the
Standish Guards by the recent consolidation. Maj. Morrissey
became, after the war, Sergeant-at-Arms in the Boston
State House.</p>

<p>The 3d were mustered into U. S. service for nine months
on Sept. 23, 1862. As their numbers were too great for a
single transport, two vessels received the regiment, the
“Merrimac” and the “Mississippi.” Off Cape Cod the men
experienced inconvenience similar to that of 1861; and many
communed with the great deep. Thereafter the voyage was
thru calm water, not even Cape Hatteras proving sufficient
to stir up trouble. Landing was made at Beaufort, North
Carolina, whence trains conveyed the regiment to Newbern.
That town was originally settled by Swiss colonists; as,
however, it bore small trace of Helvetian thriftiness and
neatness in 1862, our men found nothing to admire. But
the district was of much military importance as a source of
supplies and channel of communication for Richmond and
Lee’s army. The 3d, under Gen. Foster, was side by side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
with the 43d and 44th Regiments, both of which have place
in Coast Artillery history. They participated in the “great
march” thru Kinston, Whitehall and Goldsboro. June 11,
1863, the regiment embarked for home; and was mustered
out June 26.</p>

<p>Veterans of the 4th Regiment residing in Taunton organized
the Taunton City Guard on Nov. 4, 1865, thus giving
that city a competitor to its older Light Guard. The
company entered the 3d Regiment in 1866, and today exists
as the 9th Company, Mass. C. A. For a few months there
was an exciting rivalry between the two Taunton companies,
as each claimed to be the rightful owner of certain military
property in the city,&mdash;camp equipage and a fund of $800
coming down from war days. The property would be first
concealed by one company and then captured by the other.
The courts were appealed to; but finally the matter was compromised;
they divided the money, and the companies became
joint owners of the tentage and other equipment.</p>

<p>Orders were issued by the State authorities on Aug. 20,
1866, combining the 4th and 3d Regiments in a new 3d Regiment,
and on Aug. 31, Col. Mason W. Burt of Taunton
was elected commander. Col. Burt had been Captain and
Major in the 22d Mass. Volunteers from 1861 to 1864. The
new regiment consisted of companies in Halifax (A), Fall
River (B), Scituate (C), New Bedford (E), Taunton (F)
and (G), and Quincy (H). The Halifax Light Infantry,
the New Bedford City Guards, B of Fall River, and, a little
later, the revived D of Fall River under Capt. Sierra L.
Braley, with a new Scituate company, represented the 3d
Regiment; while the Taunton Light Guard and Hancock
Light Guards of Quincy came from the 4th Regiment. The
new Taunton company entered the 3d at this time; but the
Standish Guards remained aloof, as the 87th Unattached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Company, until 1868. At the latter date the Plymouth company
came in as Co. M. Thomas J. Borden became Colonel
June 23, 1868, and Bradford D. Davol followed on March
9, 1871, both being residents of Fall River. When on Aug.
2, 1876, the regiment was reduced to a battalion, the “3d
Battalion of Infantry,” its only surviving companies were
the New Bedford City Guards (E), the Taunton City
Guards (F), the Taunton Light Guard (G), and the Standish
Guards (now H). All others had been disbanded.
Maj. Daniel A. Butler, former Captain of the Standish
Guards, commanded the 3d Battalion. Meanwhile the Cunningham
Rifles of North Bridgewater or Brockton had been
organized in 1869, and named after the Adjutant General,
James A. Cunningham. Originally Co. I of the 3d, this
command was transferred to the 1st Battalion of Infantry,
Lt. Col. Wales, in 1876; and so pioneered the way for the
remainder of the “Cape” companies to follow two years
later. This company exists today as the 10th Company,
Mass. C. A.</p>

<p>One cause contributing to the disappearance of the 3d
Regiment was the fact that it was called upon to perform
two tours of duty for the maintenance of public order in
Fall River, first on Aug. 5, 1870, continuing three days, and
again Sept. 27, 1875, continuing seven days. Such service
in connection with industrial disturbance is exceedingly
painful to the feelings of the men. Coming as it did when
class sensitiveness was acute, and when the old Civil War
veterans were ready to retire permanently from active military
service, it did much to break up the command. Happily
such a situation can hardly recur today.</p>

<p>The 3d Regiment participated in musters with the 1st
Brigade from 1866 to 1871, the final one being held at Lovell’s
Plain, North Weymouth. In 1872 there was a regimental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
encampment at their old Civil War mobilization
ground, “Camp Joe Hooker,” Lakeville.</p>

<p>On Dec. 3, 1878, Major Butler’s four-company battalion
was consolidated with the 1st and 4th Battalions as part of
the 1st Regiment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>SINCE 1878</h3>


<p>Col. Wales’ regiment, when he received his commission
on Dec. 30, 1878, consisted of the following twelve companies:</p>

<div class="container"><ul>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;1, The Roxbury Artillery or City Guard.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;2, The Boston Light Infantry.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;3, The Taunton Light Guard.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;4, The New Bedford City Guards.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;5, The Standish Guards of Plymouth.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;6, The Massachusetts Guards of Cambridge.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;7, The Pierce Light Guard of Boston.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;8, The West Roxbury Rifles.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;9, The Taunton City Guard.</li>
<li>10, The Cunningham Rifles of Brockton.</li>
<li>11, The Maverick Rifles of East Boston.</li>
<li>12, The Fall River Rifles.</li>
</ul></div>

<p class="cont">The Fusiliers and the Chelsea Rifle-Veterans were temporarily
detached from the regiment, and the Claflin Guards
were gone, never to return so far as we now know.</p>

<p>The 1st and 8th Companies were directly from the 1st
Regiment. The 2d, 6th, 7th and 11th Companies came from
the 4th Battalion; the 3d Company came originally from
the 4th Regiment and immediately from the 3d; the 4th,
5th and 9th Companies were from the 3d Regiment; the
10th was originally from the 3d and immediately from the
1st. A new 12th Company was organized on Dec. 12, 1878,
with Capt. Sierra L. Braley in command. The new company
speedily forged to the head in efficiency and has always
been one of the three or four leaders in the entire regiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Boston celebrated the 250th anniversary of its settlement
on Sept. 17, 1880, and along with other features included a
magnificent military display. Everyone conceded that, while
other bodies presented a fine appearance, the feature of the
parade was the twelve-company 1st Regiment. That day,
for the last time, the companies wore their original uniforms&mdash;old
1st Regiment, gray with towering bearskin
shakos; 4th Battalion, a semi-Zouave costume with low
shakos, double breasted blue coats, light blue bloused
knickerbockers, and high leather leggins; and the 3d Regiment,
low shakos, short blue coats, single-breasted but with
three rows of buttons, and blue trousers. The regiment was
received enthusiastically by the people of Boston and the
day was one long to be remembered.</p>

<p>But changes were projected in the interests of efficiency,
and first of all, in that very year, 1880, it was decided to
adopt the 4th Battalion uniform for the entire twelve companies.
So satisfactory did this prove that the Commonwealth
utilized the same costume as a state uniform, and
issued it to all the organizations of Massachusetts in 1884.
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery; but it can scarcely
be said that the 1st relished sharing their distinctive uniform
with all the militia,&mdash;they felt that they had paid dearly for
this flattery.</p>

<p>Thereafter the regiment was to be subjected to a continuous
and intensifying process of military improvement, at
the hands first of the state authorities, and presently of the
“Department of Militia Affairs” or “Militia Bureau” in the
War Department. While it was inevitable that there should
be a deal of experimentation whose results were not always
satisfactory, it remains true that constant progress was made
thruout the ensuing years. National Guardsmen, since they
are human, are prone to complain; certainly they greeted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
almost every innovation with a chorus of “kicks.” But as
soon as a change had demonstrated its usefulness, it was
heartily welcomed. More and more time was demanded of
the men; and on the other hand part of this increased service
was rewarded with increased pay by the State or Nation.
The four days of camp duty required in 1873 had
stretched to fifteen days in 1916, the twelve armory drills
of early days to forty-eight. State and Federal pay were
not an adequate recompense for the labor performed; the
service was still one of unselfish patriotism. But the
money invested by the authorities in camp and “rendezvous
drill” pay did unquestionably testify to the higher esteem
in which, with the passing years, the Guard came to stand.
One noticeable consequence of the increasing military strictness
was the gradual lowering of average age amongst the
companies. Older men cannot be away from their business
or families for so many hours and days, under ordinary circumstances.
American armies have always been made up
of very young men; and under the stress of increased requirements,
the National Guard came to be similarly constituted.</p>

<p>One company participated in the exercises connected with
the funeral of Pres. James A. Garfield at Cleveland in
1881.</p>

<p>Nathaniel Wales was elected Brigadier General on Feb.
21, 1882, and on Feb. 24, Austin C. Wellington became
Colonel. The Tiger battalion, during the eight years of
Wellington’s command, had become the most prominent
military institution in Boston; now the entire 1st Regiment
was to profit by the skill of the same man, a skill truly
amounting to genius. Peculiar qualities are demanded of
one who is to succeed in highest degree as a National
Guardsman. He must be a well-trained soldier and a hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
worker as a matter of course. He must command respect
for his personal character and must be able to impart knowledge
to others. He must enforce rigid discipline, and must
do it without resorting to regular army methods of punishment.
On top of all, there has to be sufficient personal magnetism
in his make-up to attract men, and enthusiasm
enough to overflow and fire others. This description of a
model Guardsman is nothing more or less than a description
of Austin C. Wellington. No wonder that during his six
years of command, the regiment was to register a new
high-water mark of success.</p>

<p>Now the old companies began to come back. When in
1883 the Standish Guards suffered disbandment, their place
was promptly taken by the company which had originally
held it, the Chelsea Rifles. The Taunton Light Guard
ceased to exist in 1884, and at first, the vacant 3d number
was filled by the formation of a new company in Natick.
Four years later the Natick organization transferred and
became Co. L of the 9th, and then the Fusiliers returned to
their proper place as 3d Company.</p>

<p>1882 was notable for the Daniel Webster centennial. Pres.
Chester A. Arthur honored Boston with a visit on this occasion,
and on Oct. 11, the 1st Regiment served as Presidential
escort during the celebration at Marshfield. The habit of
visiting distant cities now grew on the regiment, so that on
August 8, 1885, they were found in New York participating
in the tremendous funeral procession in honor of their old-time
commander-in-chief, U. S. Grant. Their fame grew.</p>

<p>All Roxbury joined in celebrating the centennial of its
favorite corps, the City Guard, in 1884. March 22 of that
year will long be remembered for its parade, and other
demonstrations of affectionate enthusiasm. In 1886 the
12th Company visited Providence, R. I., as guests of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Light Infantry; and assisted their hosts to celebrate in fitting
manner the two hundred fiftieth anniversary of Rhode
Island’s settlement. 1887 brought the Fusilier centennial;
and was likewise properly observed.</p>

<p>In 1887 the United States celebrated the centenary of the
signing of its constitution, choosing Philadelphia, where the
document had been drafted, as the place for the demonstration.
Massachusetts decided to send Gov. Oliver Ames and
to provide, as his military escort, the most proficient regiment
in the State. It was not necessary to lose any time
searching for the regiment&mdash;orders were promptly issued
to Col. Wellington, that he prepare his command for the
Philadelphia trip, the Commonwealth to pay expenses.
Sept. 15 found the regiment on its way to Philadelphia,
Sept. 16 saw them marching as one of the most brilliant
units of the great parade under command of Gen. Philip
H. Sheridan, while Sept. 17 was signalized by their return
to Boston. D. W. Reeves was band-leader that year&mdash;no
unworthy successor to Fillebrown and Gilmore&mdash;and he
contributed, as his share in the event, a new march, “The
March of the First.” Chaplain Minot J. Savage, who added
to his gift of eloquence the rarer talent of poetry, wrote
words for Reeves’ music,</p>

<div class="container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0">“We’re brothers of all noble men,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who wear our country’s blue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We brothers find in any race,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where men are brave and true.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But we’ve a pride in our own band,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And we are all agreed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever grand deeds others do,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The ‘Old First’ still shall lead.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="cont">The fame of the regiment became nation-wide as a consequence
of the Philadelphia trip.</p>

<p>Col. Wellington’s most notable innovation was the introduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
of artillery instruction, or the re-introduction,
as it was for those companies originally in the old First.
The change was made for the purpose of rendering drills
more interesting. It is easier to maintain the interest of
artillerymen&mdash;they have their guns as a rallying-point.
Moreover the artillery virus was in the 1st Regiment blood
and was bound eventually to manifest its presence.</p>

<p>That year of Col. Wellington’s accession, 1882, the legislature
appropriated $5,000 for the construction of “Battery
Dalton” at Framingham. Named in honor of the Adjutant
General, Samuel Dalton, it was truly a marvelous work of
coast defence. Its mortars had a range of five hundred
yards. After firing the projectile, the cannoneers walked
over and solemnly dug the same up from its self-made
grave, and fired it over again. Artillery practice was
economically conducted in those pioneer days. Sept. 13,
1883, the regiment was permitted to hold one day’s practice
at Fort Warren, a great concession by the War Department,
and a long step in artillery progress. Sept. 4, 1885, one
month after the Grant funeral, the privilege of artillery
practice was repeated.</p>

<p>A riot in Cambridge brought the 6th Company into active
service for two days on Feb. 21 and 22, 1887.</p>

<p>Col. Wellington’s death occurred while he still filled the
office of regimental commander, on Sept. 18, 1888. The
funeral is said to have been the saddest tour of duty ever
performed by the regiment, an expression of heart-felt
grief. They were then looking forward to occupying the new
South Armory; and everyone contributed the entire pay
received for the day toward the expenses of a memorial
room in the building. This money equipped and furnished
the gymnasium in the tower, the room now devoted to the
war-game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Thomas R. Mathews, Colonel from Dec. 10, 1888, until
July 19, 1897, had served in the 2d Company during the
Civil War, and had subsequently been Captain of the 1st
Co. (in 1880). On Oct. 8, 1888, just before Col. Mathews’
election, the regiment took part in a general mobilization
of militia in Boston. On Thanksgiving day, Nov. 28, 1889,
the Boston companies were assembled at the armories in
readiness for service in maintaining public order at a great
fire then raging. Fortunately they did not have to leave their
stations.</p>

<p>Prior to 1890 the Companies had been quartered in various
halls and rinks of Boston and the suburbs, Faneuil Hall
being the most coveted location, unavailable, however, most
of the time, and Boylston Hall, Boylston and Washington
Streets, ranking next.</p>

<p>1890 was the date of the South Armory dedication. Massachusetts
had entered, after long years of discussion, upon
her policy of providing adequate accommodations for her
volunteer militia. New York had led the way ten years
earlier; and the Massachusetts authorities were especially indebted
to the N. Y. 7th for providing an armory after
which others could pattern. It is a far cry from the 7th’s
building to that on Irvington St., but there is a similarity
of type. It must be borne in mind that the South Armory
was relatively one of the best in the country when the 1st
Regiment occupied it in 1890. Nor had the railroad developed
into such a nuisance at that time. The South
Armory was the first State armory in Massachusetts; and
led the way for the entire series, by means of which our
troops are quartered as well as any in the land; its dedication
was an important event in military history. Fall River
followed, and dedicated her State armory in 1895, Cambridge
and New Bedford in 1903, Brockton in 1906, Chelsea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
in 1907, and Taunton in 1917. Chelsea and Brockton subsequently
lost their buildings by fire; the structures were
rebuilt respectively in 1909 and 1912.</p>

<p>Col. Mathews’ command served as personal escort to
Gov. William E. Russell, Feb. 29, 1892, at the ceremony
of presenting Massachusetts’ first long-service medals.
Amongst others, twenty-eight officers and men of the 1st
received medals.</p>

<p>An artillery tour was held at Fort Warren, Aug. 7 to 13,
1892, when the men had practice on the eight-inch muzzle-loading
converted rifles and the fifteen-inch muzzle-loading
smooth-bores. Modern coast artillery had not yet “arrived”;
but the regiment was making progress. In 1893
they encamped at Framingham and manned “Battery Dalton”
once more. In 1895 they had their last experience with
these twelve-inch mortars&mdash;and the sand-bank five hundred
yards away; 1894, 1896 and 1897 saw them at Fort Warren
each summer. In 1896 the regulars did not take them seriously
and could not “waste time” instructing the militiamen;
in 1897, with Lieut. Erasmus M. Weaver temporarily
detailed as instructor, the regiment made progress. Thereafter,
until 1911, regular officers from the forts added to
their other service the duty of visiting the South Armory
and coaching the militia regiment.</p>

<p>All twelve companies were ordered to be in readiness on
March 10, 1893, for service in connection with the disastrous
“Lincoln St. fire,” but were not marched out of the
armories.</p>

<p>The state expended $2,500 in 1894 providing a model
battery at the South Armory. While crude compared with
the huge gun and mortar installed in 1913, to which the
name “Battery Lombard” is sometimes given, this earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
artillery installation marked a long advance in drills and
instruction.</p>

<p>On Oct. 9, 1894, the regiment again participated in a general
mobilization of the militia at Boston. The monument
to Robert Gould Shaw, on the Common, was formally dedicated
May 31, 1897, and the regiment paraded in honor of
the event. One feature of the day recalled certain historic
processions of thirty years previously&mdash;the New York 7th,
in which Col. Shaw had once served, came on to have a
share in this demonstration of affection.</p>

<p>On June 1, 1897, by act of the legislature, the regiment
received a new name&mdash;it became the 1st Regiment of Heavy
Artillery. In point of fact it had begun to separate from
the 1st Brigade back in Col. Wellington’s time, and had become
increasingly committed to the artillery branch; this
act of legislation officially recognized a transition which had
already taken place. Now the facings on the uniforms
could be changed from the blue of infantry to the brighter
and more distinctive scarlet. Massachusetts was the first
state to have heavy artillery in its militia&mdash;the old regiment
was again “first.” Companies were rechristened “batteries”
in connection with the change of service.</p>

<p>Col. Mathews became Brigadier General on July 19, 1897,
and Charles Pfaff succeeded as Colonel on July 28. Col.
Pfaff’s military training had been in the Cadets, and as Captain
of the 8th Company, Coast Artillery; and he had served
four years as Major. To him was to fall the honor of
commanding the regiment during its Spanish War service.</p>

<p>There was nothing unexpected about the war with Spain.
From the day the “Maine” was destroyed until April 25,
when war was declared, more than two months elapsed.
Members of the command were in constant readiness during
this entire period for the summons which they knew must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
come; and it was well understood that instant mobilization
would ensue upon receipt of orders.</p>

<p>But if we had reason to be in readiness, we also
had good cause to anticipate danger and hardship. The
United States was notorious for lack of preparedness, both
by land and sea. On the other hand the might of the Spanish
fleet and the fame of the “Spanish infantry” had been
so magnified that much popular trepidation existed. Boston
anticipated instant attack; merchants and bankers deposited
their treasure with inland banks; while real estate owners
were insistent that the national government should afford
them protection. Col. Pfaff and his men were to volunteer
in the belief that they would meet with instant and active
fighting. Beyond question the general public drew a deep
sigh of relief as the blue-clad column, on that fateful 26th
of April, to the music of the “March of the First,” swung
steadily down Huntington Ave. The out-of-town commands
had left their home stations early and received Godspeed
from newsboys and milkmen only. In Boston, however,
the display of enthusiasm left nothing to be desired; and
demonstrated not only the city’s dependence upon its heavy
artillerymen but also its real affection for the red-legged
organization. They were paid from April 25.</p>

<p>Besides Col. Pfaff, the regimental officers were: Lt. Col.,
Charles B. Woodman; Majors, Perlie A. Dyar, George F.
Quinby, James A. Frye; Captains, 1st Co., Joseph H. Frothingham;
2d Co., Frederic S. Howes; 3d Co., Albert B.
Chick; 4th Co., Joseph L. Gibbs; 5th Co., Walter L. Pratt;
6th Co., Walter E. Lombard; 7th Co., Charles P. Nutter;
8th Co., John Bordman, Jr.; 9th Co., Norris O. Danforth;
10th Co., Charles Williamson; 11th Co., Frederick M.
Whiting; 12th Co., Sierra L. Braley. Capt. Braley had been
private and corporal in the 3d Reg. during its nine-months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
service in 1862. He had been 2d Lieutenant in Battery I, 2d
Mass. Heavy Art., and in Bat. L, 14th U. S. Colored Art.,
during 1864 and 1865. From 1866 until 1878 he continuously
held commissions in the 3d Reg. and, after 1878, in
the 1st, his latest command being the 12th Company. Capt.
Braley was the only officer of the regiment to serve in both
the Civil and Spanish Wars.</p>

<p>On April 26 the regiment began active duty at Fort
Warren, the orders reading that they would encamp there
for eight days. Five more days were added to this; and
then the command was taken into the U. S. service “for
the war.” Since the thirteen days of state duty is added
to the total in computing their record, they were the first
regiment of the entire nation to begin war service. The Old
First still led.</p>

<p>When they left the armory for Fort Warren, there were
only six men absent from the command&mdash;four sick and two
out of the country. Opportunity was later given for men
with families to withdraw, if they desired; and all were
subjected to a rigid physical examination. Ultimately three
per cent. were rejected for disability and eight per cent.
excused for family reasons. These vacancies were immediately
filled from the throngs of would-be recruits who volunteered.
It was a disappointment to the regiment that the
War Department never permitted them to increase their
numbers to the full war strength; their Spanish War
roster bore 751 names.</p>

<p>They started out in the rain on April 26, and it seemed as
if it would rain until they returned; during their first six
weeks, they were blest with sunshine only three days. By
and by, when they had ceased to care, the weather changed
and they had sunny days. At Warren they were quartered
in wooden buildings, originally election booths in the city;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
prisoners from Deer Island were imported to assist in erecting
these; and some humorist promptly designated them the
“3d Corps of Cadets.” While in the state service, the regiment
was fed by a caterer, after the fashion then prevalent
at Framingham. When they became U. S. soldiers, they
messed themselves. All thru this war, ammunition was
very scarce indeed. The least a self-respecting military
post can do is to fire morning and evening guns; this was
possible in 1898 only by cutting cartridges in two and using
half-charges. Most of the ordnance was of Civil War vintage,
or very slightly more modern.</p>

<p>Spain had been vastly over-rated, and there was very
little fight in her. The regiment passed a busy and profitable
month at Fort Warren from April 26 to May 30, being
mustered into the United States service on May 7. During
these weeks the companies or “batteries” attained a high
degree of proficiency in both infantry and artillery drill.
Shortly after midnight on May 13 the Engineers’ steamer,
the “Tourist,” came down the harbor from the Navy Yard
to announce that the Spanish fleet had actually been sighted
off Nantucket. But men watched in vain for the enemy
vessels to appear.</p>

<p>On Memorial day, thru the exigency of service conditions,
the companies were moved and distributed along the coast
at posts ranging from Portsmouth to New Bedford. Maj.
Frye and the Cape companies remained at Warren. Lt. Col.
Woodman with the 3d and 11th Companies garrisoned the
fort at Clark’s Point, New Bedford, a work which had been
in existence since 1857 but which awaited July 23, 1898, and
these companies as godfathers, before it was christened
Fort Rodman. The Colonel, Headquarters, and the remaining
six companies proceeded by boat to various points along
the North Shore, at some of which militia field artillery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
batteries had previously been on guard, the Colonel himself
being stationed at Salem in command of the entire Essex
County district. This transfer of troops was accomplished
without peril or even discomfort. The 1st and 7th Companies
under Maj. Dyar became the garrison at Salem; Maj.
Quinby and the 2d Company were at Gloucester; the 6th
Company was on Plum Island near Newburyport, and subsequently
at Portsmouth; the 5th Company at Marblehead;
and the 8th at Nahant as guard of the mining-casemate.
Lieuts. E. Dwight Fullerton of the 8th Company and P.
Frank Packard of the 2d were specially detailed to duty
with the regulars at Fort Columbus, Governor’s Island,
New York, and remained there several months. Lieut.
Fullerton was called upon to untangle the snarl into which
the War Department had gotten with regard to records of
sick soldiers in the New York hospitals.</p>

<p>It fell to the lot of certain “batteries” to reconstruct and
man ancient earthworks whose history ran back many years.
At Salem, Fort Pickering was put in commission; at
Gloucester, the old Stage Fort where Myles Standish once
came near having a battle; near Portsmouth, Forts Constitution
and McClary; and at Marblehead, Fort Sewall. This
is very romantic to relate. No doubt the renovated works
with their armament of obsolete field pieces could have
afforded some protection against Spanish raiders. But
those who were called upon to occupy works built for
seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth century warfare,
and modernize them so as to render them useful under
twentieth century conditions, agree in testifying that the
romance is all in the narrative and not any in the fact. The
6th Company had at first been stationed in an earthwork
on the Plum Island beach which had been constructed by the
field battery, whom they relieved; as Plum Island, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
June, is notable chiefly for flies and fleas, this company was
glad enough when the transfer to Portsmouth brought the
men again on solid ground. Fort Constitution had a long
history&mdash;it used to be known as Fort William and Mary,
and from its ancient magazine came the powder used by the
patriots at Bunker Hill; but in 1898 it was a comparatively
modern work, and mounted a battery of eight-inch rifles.</p>

<p>This Spanish War service is something of which the regiment
are justly proud. On April 26, Col. Pfaff led 99 per
cent. of the full militia strength of his command into the
harbor forts, itself a conclusive demonstration that the National
Guard is a dependable force. Foremost were they in
the entire United States to assume their post of duty. First
of all volunteers were they to be mustered in; the genius
of “The Old First” was in control. Thruout the entire two-hundred-three
days of duty they maintained the very highest
standards of efficiency and discipline. It noway lessened
the credit belonging to these volunteer soldiers that the
Spaniards were so wise as to keep at a safe distance from
the Massachusetts coast; the warmest kind of a welcome
was awaiting them, had they come. When on Nov. 14, the
command were mustered out of Federal service and returned
to the militia, they had added a most creditable
chapter to the long annals of their organization.</p>

<p>In 1899 a tour of duty was performed at Fort Rodman;
and so satisfactory did it prove that the post was chosen
for the annual coast defence exercises, with one exception,
until 1906. In 1902 some companies were stationed at Fort
Greble and other Rhode Island posts. The only serious
objections to Rodman were the haze and fog, which hang
low over Buzzard’s Bay. As a consequence of the Spanish
War, the flannel shirt and the khaki suit became part of the
regimental uniform. Oct. 14, 1899, the regiment participated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
in the ovation to Admiral George Dewey, and at the
same time turned their Spanish War flags and colors over
to the custody of the State. Col. Pfaff retired as Brigadier
General Apr. 20, 1900. His loyal and generous interest in
the old regiment has been shown in making possible the
publication of this history.</p>

<p>Col. James A. Frye, who commanded the regiment from
May 4, 1900, until Jan. 4, 1906, had served as Major during
the Spanish War. Upon relinquishing command of the regiment,
he became Adj. Gen. of the State. Col. Frye was the
one selected to record the services of the command during
the Spanish War; and his history will always stand as a
worthy monument to his memory.</p>

<p>In 1903 the regiment participated in joint coast defence
and naval maneuvers at Portland harbor, of which the chief
feature was the long hours. The men were on duty all day
and all night, so that sleeping almost became a forgotten
art. On June 25, 1903, the Coast Artillery shared in the
exercises of dedication around the magnificent statue of
their old commander, Gen. Joseph Hooker. Members of
the regiment had been foremost in securing the appropriation
for the statue; and heartily did they rejoice to see the
beautiful bronze by D. C. French which finally crowned
their labor.</p>

<p>1903 witnessed the most important national militia legislation
since the original militia act of 1792. By the “Dick law,”
with amendments added in 1908, the militia really became a
national force, with clearly defined liability of service; and
the name, National Guard, was officially conferred upon it.
Nevertheless Massachusetts continued to call her citizen
soldiers Volunteer Militia. 1904 brought the adoption of
magazine-rifles.</p>

<p>On Nov. 1, 1905, the regiment was redesignated as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
“Corps of Coast Artillery,” a title which has been used by
anticipation at various times in this book. Behind the
change lay the fact that the War Department had been testing
militia heavy or coast artillery; and the latter, in the estimation
of the Washington authorities, were not found wanting.
A regiment is a closely united body, and is supposed
to operate as a unit. A corps, on the contrary, is a group
of smaller units associated for administrative purposes, but
acting more or less independently in warfare. Tactically a
corps is not a unit; each of its members is. Inasmuch as
few forts require so much as a full regiment of coast artillery
to garrison them, it was deemed best to organize the
artillery in smaller units, in companies, better suited to the
needs of the average fort. Companies are combined in fort
commands of two or more each. Moreover, by 1905, a clear
distinction had arisen between coast artillery and heavy
artillery; and it was necessary for organizations to decide
which branch of the service they would choose. Heavy
artillery follows a mobile army, and is used to batter down
fortifications. Coast artillery mans the guns and submarine
mines of our coast fortifications, and is not a mobile force.
A moment’s consideration will convince anyone that the
Massachusetts men chose the more exciting branch, when
they became coast artillery. The heavy artillery fire from
great distances, while themselves entirely out of range of
any answering shots, and fire at fixed targets. The coast
artillery fire at ships, moving targets possessing the ability
to return our shots, who will certainly and quickly “get
us” unless we “get them” first. An increase of interest
in the scientific side of artillery work immediately followed,
and stimulated every officer and enlisted man to do his best.
Companies were no longer termed “batteries,” but were
given numbers, the designations indicating seniority of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
charter. The band continued to wear the old regimental
number “1” on their uniforms.</p>

<p>To the twelve companies of the Corps were, in 1907,
assigned regular stations in the fortifications of Boston
harbor, to which it would be their duty to repair at once in
case of threatened hostilities. As they exercised each summer
on the very guns which they would man in actual service,
they grew familiar with their work to a degree never
before possible. After experimenting at seven different
posts, in 1913 the 1st, 2d, 3d, and 6th Companies became
part of the garrison of Fort Strong on Long Island (named
in honor of Gen. Wm. K. Strong); the 5th, 7th, 8th and
11th Companies were assigned to Fort Andrews; and the
4th, 9th, 10th and 12th Companies to Fort Warren.</p>

<p>Col. Charles P. Nutter commanded the Corps from Jan.
23, 1906, until March 10, 1910; he had been Captain of the
7th Company during the Spanish War. In August, 1907,
the companies participated in a general mobilization of
militia at Boston in connection with the “old home week”
celebration. The War Department now determined to make
a slight change in the name of the organization, perhaps in
the interest of alphabetic symmetry. Whatever the cause
may have been, on Nov. 15, 1907, the words were transposed
and the “Corps of Coast Artillery” became the “Coast
Artillery Corps.”</p>

<p>It had been so long since the Boston companies were
called out to maintain public order at a great fire, that such
a contingency was not regarded seriously. Suddenly, on
April 12, 1908, as men were returning from Palm Sunday
services, they received word that Chelsea was in the clutch
of a mammoth conflagration. Vast clouds of smoke could
be seen arising on the north-eastern horizon; Boston’s
neighbor was indeed stricken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>The 5th Company promptly responded to the call for
help; but it was evident that assistance must come from
outside; local forces were entirely inadequate to meet the
emergency. At 5 <span class="smcap lowercase">P. M.</span> the other companies were assembled
at their armories; and at 8.30, after eating a hearty supper,
they started for their posts of duty. The work was of the
usual sort, rescuing property and saving lives, guarding the
property from vandals and thieves, and assisting the young,
the weak and the aged to places of safety. Only men in
uniform command confidence at such a season of disorder;
only disciplined men, working together, can accomplish
results. Right nobly did the Corps meet its responsibilities
during its three days in Chelsea, and many a firm friend did
it win for the organization. The 5th Company continued
on duty five days longer.</p>

<p>Upon the local company fell an especially cruel test.
First, their new State armory came in the path of the flames
and was swept to ruins&mdash;while the troops, on duty in the
streets, were aware that their own civilian clothing in the
lockers was going up in smoke. Worse yet, the fire spread
until it involved the homes of many militiamen. The soldiers
could hardly keep their thoughts on their work, while
their own loved ones were in danger, and their own household
effects in need of removal to places of safety; their
minds wandered homeward&mdash;but the men themselves quietly
kept their posts. There never has been any question about
the discipline of the Corps in seasons of emergency; the
5th Company proved true to the ancient traditions.</p>

<p>Companies of the Corps had been visiting Washington at
inauguration time ever since 1835; and almost the entire
command went in honor of T. Roosevelt in 1905; finally,
in 1909, the Corps went as a regiment and participated in
the inaugural parade of President William H. Taft. Participants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
in such a parade invite comparison between themselves
and troops from many other states&mdash;military critics,
such as Maj. Gen. J. Franklin Bell and Brig. Gen. E. M.
Weaver, were unanimous in asserting that the Mass. Coast
Artillery Corps and the West Point Cadets bore off the palm
for fine military appearance, not even the N. Y. 7th doing
as well.</p>

<p>By 1909 the Corps had settled in its custom of holding
coast defence exercises at the harbor forts; consequently,
it was with disappointment and even resentment that they
found themselves ordered to serve as infantry in the so-called
Cape maneuvers in August of that year. A difference
of opinion had arisen between the Adjutant General of Massachusetts
and the Corps officers concerning money matters;
and this tour of duty was laid on the latter as a penalty.
Soldiers must obey orders; however irksome and unwelcome
the service, no one in the “blue army” could truthfully
say that the “red-legged infantry” fell below their comrades
in efficiency.</p>

<p>Col. Walter E. Lombard was in command from March
17, 1910, until Feb. 21, 1915. At the latter date he became
a Major General on the retired list. Col. Lombard had
been Captain of the 6th Company during the Spanish War.</p>

<p>In June, 1911, the War Department detailed a regular
army officer to the Corps as Inspector-instructor, Capt.
Russell P. Reeder being the first to perform that duty; at
once the standards of instruction were improved, and the
artillery work profited greatly from the presence of such a
skilled teacher. Sergeant-instructors, four in number, were
presently added as assistants to the commissioned officer
who performed the chief duties. An immediate result of the
Inspector-instructor’s work was the wonderful shooting done
by the 4th, 12th and other companies during the 1911 tour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of duty. After that date all officers were required to qualify
in the technical part of their work by passing regular War
Department examinations. The fourth officer to fill this
detail, Capt. William H. Wilson, commenced service in Jan.,
1915, and soon succeeded in systematizing the work of drill
and instruction to a point far beyond anything previously
attempted; so that his term of duty brought about a great
increase of Corps efficiency. Capt. Wilson was especially
qualified for this service in that he had himself been a National
Guardsman, and had entered the U. S. army from a
New York regiment. Capt. Wilson not only emphasized the
artillery work; he also laid stress upon matters thitherto
slighted,&mdash;company administration, higher infantry, and
gunners’ instruction.</p>

<p>Again in March, 1913, the entire Corps made its customary
pilgrimage to Washington for the purpose of participating
in the Presidential inauguration, this time paying the
honor to Woodrow Wilson. As in 1909, so now, they were
most enthusiastically praised for their fine military appearance
and splendid marching. On May 30, 1913, the Gate
City Guard of Atlanta, Ga., visited Boston as guests of the
Tigers. 1913 was the fifteenth anniversary of the regiment’s
service in the Spanish war; and on Sept. 20, Col. Lombard
tendered a review on the Common to the veterans. On that
occasion active officers marched with the veterans, in the
positions which they had filled fifteen years previously. Lt.
Col. Woodman was in command of the veterans, and Col.
Lombard marched as Captain of the 6th Company; while
Maj. Shedd led the actives. After the parade, there was
a collation, followed by motion pictures, in the Armory.</p>

<p>So well had the 5th Company acquitted themselves at the
Chelsea fire that they were one of the commands called
out to maintain order at Salem when, on June 25, 1914, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
ancient city was threatened with destruction; the emergency
was similar to that of 1908. To the Chelsea men fell
the duty of organizing a huge camp of refugees at Forest
River park; and they remained in service seven days.</p>

<p>Joseph Hooker was born Nov. 13, 1814, and exactly one
hundred years later, his loyal admirers, among whom were
numbered the officers of the Coast Artillery Corps, paraded,
and participated in a great meeting at Tremont Temple in
honor of his memory. Capt. Isaac P. Gragg, former Captain
of the 1st Company, was always the prime mover in organizing
celebrations in memory of Hooker, and he justly felt
that the event of 1914 was the culmination of his life-work.
Alas! Capt. Gragg did not long survive the centennial of
his beloved commander.</p>

<p>Edward Dwight Fullerton was elected Colonel Feb. 9,
1915, and continued in command until retired as Brigadier
General, January 16, 1917; he had served as 1st Lieutenant
of the 8th Company during the Spanish War.</p>

<p>The “House of Governors” was in session at Boston in
Aug., 1915, and Gov. David I. Walsh ordered a mobilization
of the militia on Aug. 26, as a compliment to the State’s
guests. As the authorized strength of the companies had
recently been raised, the Boston papers commented upon
the appearance of the Corps, in fifteen platoons of twenty
files, as “wonderful,” not only for numbers, but for steady
marching.</p>

<p>President Wilson called the militia out for service on the
Mexican border June 18, 1916. Massachusetts shared with
New Jersey the honor of placing her full quota of organizations
at the post of danger in the shortest time; and since
the Massachusetts quota was far larger than that of New
Jersey, her record was the more creditable. On the ninth day
after the troops were summoned to arms, they started for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Texas. Of course the Coast Artillery could not be included in
this great national mobilization, as they might not safely be
spared from their stations at the forts. But on June 26, the
day the mobile troops started south, the officers and non-commissioned
officers of the Corps were assembled at the
Framingham mobilization camp (“Camp Whitney”) for
the purpose of drilling the hundreds of recruits there gathered.
The officers and non-commissioned officers of the 6th
Inf. also took part in this work of instruction. No recruits
for Mass. regiments ever constituted a finer personnel than
those eager to have a share in the Mexican service. Coming
from all over the state, they were uniformly willing, sober,
and quick to learn, in order that they might reach the front
as soon as possible. The Corps became responsible for the
“2d Provisional Regiment,” consisting of about one thousand
men, destined for the 8th and 9th Inf. Regiments, and
also for the cavalry, machine-guns, supply companies, field
artillery, and even for the regimental bands. Wonderfully
rapid progress was made, so that in two weeks, the recruits
were equipped, and drilled, and ready to go forward. The
Corps’ recent training in company administration stood them
in good stead and made possible such rapid work. Certain
officers of the Corps were drafted into the U. S. service, in
order to accompany the recruits on the southward journey.</p>

<p>With grave disorder on the Mexican border, and with the
greatest war of the world’s history approaching its crisis
abroad, conditions were once more favorable for Congressional
action in behalf of the militia. Since threatenings of
danger were loud and insistent, the legislators were induced
to take an additional forward step in rendering America’s
citizen-soldiers efficient. The National Defence Act, as the
new law was termed, completed the process of federalization
by placing the militia fully under War Department control,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and also provided a modest rate of remuneration for armory
drills, thus making it an object for men to maintain regular
attendance. Massachusetts had done what she could to
encourage the passage of the law, by herself adopting, during
the prolonged debate on the National Defence Act, a
State law offering to hand over her militia to the Federal
government. Indeed by her provision for remunerating
men for attendance at rendezvous drills, the Commonwealth
had taken her place beside Ohio five years previously as a
pioneer in paying her militia. The legislation became effective
on June 3, 1916, and went fully into operation on the
first of the ensuing month.</p>

<p>Right in the midst of their tour, on June 30, the officers
and men were asked to take the new Federal oath, under
provisions of this act. To the officers the oath was administered
at Framingham, while the enlisted men were assembled
in their armories that night, for the purpose of swearing
in. Almost without exception, and then always with valid
excuse, the members of the Corps assumed this additional
obligation and became Federal soldiers. Headquarters,
band, enlisted specialists, and twelve companies&mdash;the entire
Corps&mdash;were, on June 30, recognized by the War Department
as federalized National Guardsmen and were entered
upon the U. S. payrolls. Of all the Massachusetts Volunteer
Militia, the Coast Artillery Corps were the only organization
to comply fully with the new requirements and be recognized
as a unit.</p>

<p>Companies of the Corps volunteered their services in connection
with exhibitions for the benefit of the Mass. Volunteer
Aid Association, which was raising funds to relieve
distress amongst the families of National Guardsmen then
at the border. An unusually fine military display was
given at the ball-grounds in connection with a benefit ball-game<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
between the Red Sox and the St. Louis teams on
July 17.</p>

<p>Many Corps officers were detailed for recruiting duty
during the summer and autumn of 1916, in an effort to
raise the numbers of the regiments at the border to full
war-strength. Consequently the coast defence exercises at
the forts in August, 1916, were seriously handicapped.
Many men were forced to perform double duty. In spite
of this limitation, splendid artillery scores were made by
the 2d, the 6th and other Companies, the 6th Company earning
the coveted Knox trophy.</p>

<p>Successive steps followed rapidly during the summer and
autumn of 1916 to render effective the process of federalization.
By order of Gov. Samuel W. McCall on July 17, the
title “Massachusetts Volunteer Militia” was discontinued,
and the force redesignated “National Guard, Massachusetts.”
In October the War Department authorized the
companies to increase their strength from seventy-eight to
one hundred twelve officers and men; new regulations established
standards of drill and instruction with which organizations
must comply in order to qualify for pay; a National
Guard reserve was created by transfer of men who
had completed their three years of active service; promotion
requirements were established for officers; and an assistant
Inspector-instructor was detailed to the Corps, Capt. Hugh
S. Brown taking his place beside Capt. Wilson. While the
new National Guard regulations raised the standard and
“tightened the reins,” it is a tribute to the high grade of
efficiency already attained by the Corps that Federal control
caused no revolutionary changes of method in the organization.
As part of the federalizing process, on Dec. 9, 1916,
the Militia Bureau of the War Department redesignated the
command, and abolished the word Corps from its title.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Thereafter it was the “Massachusetts Coast Artillery, National
Guard.” On January 16, 1917, the organization received
back its old and well-loved designation, and became
the 1st Coast Defense Command, Massachusetts Coast Artillery,
N. G.; once more Massachusetts could speak about
her senior regiment as “The Old First.”</p>

<p>George F. Quinby, a former Lieutenant of the 7th Company
and Captain of the 2d Company, and Major during
the Spanish War, became Colonel, January 20, 1917. The
events of Col. Quinby’s administration,&mdash;our break with
Germany on February 3, the “armed neutrality,” the 5th
Company’s good fortune in being first of all the command
to engage in active service when, for twenty-four hours
they guarded the electric power-system of Chelsea against
hostile interference, the declaration of war on Good Friday,
April 6, and the Old First’s service in the war, the revival
and establishment of compulsory universal military service&mdash;must
form the subject-matter of another chapter to be
written at some later day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>FINALLY</h3>


<p>If it is a long time from 1784 to 1917, it is also a long
way from the independent companies of artillery and light
infantry of the earlier time to the present Coast Artillery;
the militia of one hundred thirty years ago could not recognize
itself in the National Guard of today. When in 1792
Congress passed the first militia law, it commenced a process
of federalization which was to progress by successive stages
until its completion in the National Defence Act of 1916;
with federalization came efficiency.</p>

<p>In the beginning, volunteer companies which owned uniforms
separated themselves from the train-band of their
day, and assumed duties and responsibilities outside of what
the State demanded from every citizen. The train-band
drilled not more than four times a year, and mainly on the
fourth Wednesday of May&mdash;the volunteers at least thrice
or fourfold that amount. In order the more easily to distinguish
themselves from the train-band, the volunteers became
artillery or light infantry or grenadiers or rifles or
cavalry; and each class sought proficiency in some special
kind of drill.</p>

<p>Boston’s companies of artillery were associated in a
small battalion several years before the light infantry companies
were willing to relinquish their independence; and
so our regimental history begins in the artillery branch.
Presently, in the days of the “legionary brigade,” regimental
spirit began to manifest itself among the light infantry companies,
resulting in the Sub-legion of light infantry. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
artillery battalion became most famous as the “Fighting
First” of Civil War times, and is today primarily represented
by the 1st Company. From the light infantry Sub-legion
there ultimately developed the old “Tiger” 1st Regiment,
of which the 2d Company is today the senior representative.
Presently a drift set in from the infantry command
to the artillery regiment, one company transferring
after another, until even the regimental number itself passed
from the former to the latter; this process is illustrated
by the career of the 3d Company. Eventually Plymouth
and Bristol counties made their valuable contribution to the
regimental composition&mdash;the remnants of the 3d and 4th
Regiments&mdash;as represented today by the 4th Company. The
consolidation of 1878 welded all these elements into a single,
compact, unified body, the Coast Artillery of today. While
the old regiment have come under complete Federal control,
and hold place in the first line of the U. S. Army, they have
not in the least abated their life-long loyalty to the State
which gave them birth.</p>

<p>“The National Guard is not only the reserve for the
regular army; it is also the reserve for the police, the fire
department, and life-saving service. Its members are genuine
soldiers of peace.” (Curtis Guild.) Twelve different
times have units of the regiment been called out by the
Commonwealth to maintain public order. On many other
occasions the companies were warned to be in readiness;
indeed the headquarters of the command is the most sensitive
barometer for registering the approach of social disorder.
Twelve times the companies actually marched forth.
Curtis Guild’s remark about the militia was intended to
apply especially to military service in connection with great
and disastrous conflagrations; five times have the regiment
performed such duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>But after all, it is war-time which tests the soldier. If he
fails to respond in his country’s hour of need, his other virtues
are of small value. Measured by this test, regimental
patriotism has shown itself to be trustworthy. In the days
just prior to the attack upon Fort Sumpter, there were in
existence seventeen companies which were destined sometime
to become associated in the present Coast Artillery. In
the seventeen companies were twelve hundred members.
By some process of magic, of patriotic magic, when the
alarm of war sounded, the twelve hundred militiamen multiplied
themselves into no less than seven thousand five
hundred volunteers. The “Old First” never failed in seasons
of public need; they were always a fighting regiment.</p>

<p>“Vigilantia,” the regimental motto, is another name for
watchfulness, for preparedness. As if the choice of a motto
were prophetic, or at least significant of the regimental character,
the Coast Artillery have always managed to be so fully
prepared that they were able to get into active service
amongst the very leaders. No troops were more prompt in
reaching the post of danger than the “minute men of ’61”;
and amongst them were our companies in the 3d and 4th
and 5th and 6th Regiments. A few weeks later the 1st
Mass. was <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'the the'">the</ins> first long-term regiment to be mustered
in thruout the entire United States, the first not only in the
Civil War, but in any war. Again in 1898, when National
Guard regiments everywhere were actively competing for
priority in volunteering, the “1st Heavies” managed to reach
their station at Fort Warren, and then to be mustered in as
a regiment, before any of their rivals in Massachusetts or

<p>Veterans of the old regiment have organized themselves
to perpetuate cherished traditions of the past. Each of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Civil War commands is represented by a veteran association&mdash;the
1st, the “Minute Men,” the 13th, the 24th, the 42d
in eastern and western sections, the 43d and others. As old
age comes on with passing time, it is inevitable that associations
of war veterans must become less numerous and less
active each year. The Coast Artillery take a real interest
in the Hooker Association and the Stevenson Memorial
Association. Amongst the companies, live veteran organizations
are maintained by graduates of the Roxbury City
Guard, the Boston Light Infantry (the Tiger Veteran
Association, incorporated March 28, 1882), the Fusiliers,
and the Pierce Lt. Guard. Indeed the Fusiliers have been
a prolific source of veteran associations. The first, the
Fusilier Veteran Association, was organized by leading
members of the company, including five ex-Captains, in
April, 1878, at the time when the company was about to
pass from the 1st to the 5th Reg., and is today in full vigor
and prosperity, retaining the old red-coat uniform. When
this association had opened its membership to others than
actual veterans, on Aug. 2, 1900, certain graduates formed
a new organization of 3d Company veterans, the Independent
Boston Fusilier Veterans. Their numbers were small,
and on July 2, 1906, in order to provide a supply of new
material, they invited veterans of other 1st Reg. companies
to join, and thus became transformed into the “1st Reg.
M. V. M. Veterans.” The latter body now has one hundred
forty members. Joe Hooker Post, No. 23, G. A. R., of
Boston, and Theodore Winthrop Post, No. 35, of Chelsea,
were made up largely of 1st Regiment veterans; and were
always in friendly and helpful relations with the active command.
With our wealth of noble heritage from the past,
comprising as we do all that remains of the old “Legionary
Brigade” and its successor, the 3d Brigade of the 1st Division,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
once Boston’s pride, and including all the 3d and 4th
Regiment organizations having continuous history, it is
desirable that the Coast Artillery should have an active association
of veterans which may combine the forces now scattered
amongst the company associations; the provision in
the National Defence act for a “reserve battalion” seems to
open a door of possibility.</p>

<p>Such a history as this can have no conclusion, it can only
halt for the moment; while the pages were in press, the
regiment was summoned by the Nation to perform military
duty. The fruit of a noble past is a useful present.
The soul of the “Old Regiment,” like John Brown’s of
which they taught America to sing, is “marching on.”</p>
